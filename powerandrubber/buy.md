MAXI PAD</B><BR>
Ok...here's how it happened. I've been using bouldering pads since
before the &quot;hogs done ate my little brother&quot;. The fatal
flaw has always been the depth Vs. support of the foam used inside
the pad. Nice big fluffy pads are great for short falls...cooshy!
On bigger falls the &quot;cooshy&quot; soon turn to ugly as you
either bottom out or twist your ankle deep in the foam. So, on
a recent trip to the boulders I found myself about 25 feet up,
pumped, getting worried, and unable to downclimb even a single
move.....I looked down at my &quot;cooshy&quot; pad. I though
of my ankles...I though of the rocks hiding under the pad....I
thought.....&quot;I need to make a new pad&quot;! I dropped like
a piano onto the &quot;cooshy&quot; and it kinda got gooshy. Yup,
bruised the ball of my foot and half twisted my ankle. I called
up the biggest foam company in the U.S. when I got back to the
office and made an appointment. After a lovely factory tour we
got down to business. They got me on the right track with more
foam info than one man should posess. Seems the only guys who
have had it right all these years were gymnasts. They bop onto
pads all day long, feet first. Think dense foam. We have incorporated
this idea of dense foam into our Maxi Pad. The Maxi Pad is about
2.5&quot; thick and even has a full length zipper so you can quickly
adjust your density to suit your needs. The Maxi Pad has an easy
carry suspension system that goes from backpack style to an over
the shoulder model in seconds. The fold over is not hinged, so
when the pad is open you have the full value of the entire pad
to bomb onto...no seams to ruin your day. The bottom fabric of
the pad is an extremely durable VCN nylon (like our Beef Bags),
which has the added advantage of &quot;sticking&quot; to slabs
and funny angles better than Cordura or other nylons. In the FISH
tradition for excess, we made the Maxi Pad close to a full 4 feet
X 5 feet. Yup, 4 X 5. Miss that! Overkill construction, peerless
durability, and a remote foot wiping swath make this pad the best
available, and far and away the best value. You can also order
the Maxi Pad without any foam. The empty version is nice if you
want to use the Maxi Pad for a home wall and you just need a nice
big sack to contain all your &quot;cooshy&quot; scraps. <BR>

<P><B>FISH MINI-PAD</B><BR>
A smaller version of our Maxi Pad. The Mini-Pad is not as small
as it sounds, logging in at a modest 36&quot; X 48&quot; and has
the same features including the padding and carry system as the
Maxi Pad. Good all around choice for a nice pad at a low price.

(Available in Mystery Bovine and Zebra only)<BR>
Here's a fun boot carrier that will help you climb better by up
to 8 letter grades! Sounds like hype, don't it? Well, let me break
it down this way: You are out cragging and as usual your boots
are floating around loose in your pack. You have a seat to BS
with some neophytes at the base of your favorite &quot;wired&quot;
problem. With a cocksure nonchalance you offer to show them the
&quot;sequence&quot;. Smug as can be you pull out your boots and
they are covered with squished prunes resulting from your impromptu
seat. Rats! Now the kids are razzing you and calling ya &quot;pops&quot;
as you try to wipe your boots clean. Never would have happened
if you had our dasBoot. Shampelt top panel lets the stink out,
420 denier pack cloth keeps the bottom intact. A grab loop and
cinch closure finish the masterpiece. Remember: Clean rubber sticks
better. Try it sometime. <STRONG>$21.00 ea.</STRONG></P>

Bags:</STRONG><BR>
We feature two chalk bags that have the wildest patterns in any
arena. Think of the craziest Hawaiian shirt ever witnessed, exotic
pelts, maybe brash prints --- sometimes even Elvis. Now, what
if you had these on your chalk bag? You'd be stoked, right? Well
here you go --- The &quot;Fist&quot; model is 7&quot; tall with
a 5.5&quot; bottom, and the &quot;Palm&quot; model is 5&quot;
tall with a 5&quot; bottom. Both bags feature a &quot;best of
both worlds&quot; stay open rim that has non-kinking cable sewn
in with numerous rows of stitching. Features a collar closure
and our uniqe pile &quot;ligament&quot; inside the bag, plus there
is a toothbrush holder for crag maintenance. An easy way to order
is to ask for &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;mild&quot; and then pick
a color theme.<STRONG>SOLD OUT</STRONG></P>

Bag:</STRONG> Our &quot;Pro Bag&quot; is one sharp piece of luggage.
We have put overkill construction methods into the world of high
fashion. The result is a totally bomber duffel bag, suave as can
be, that can hold a complete rack, rope, shoes, food, and still
have enough room for a $3.00 bottle of &quot;Thunderbird&quot;.
The main body features heavy weight Ballistic Cloth in black,
or for that sanitary look, our bomber White Vinyl haul bag fabric.
The carry handles are made from 2&quot; seatbelt webbing with
a 1&quot; tubular sleeve on the carry area. For the fashion kicker,
we put eye poppin' fur animal prints on the 12&quot; diameter
end pieces. The short hair prints are your choice of Zebra, Dalmatian,
Mystery Bovine, and Ocelot. Holy cow! You've got to see it to
believe it. 12&quot; diameter ends, 21&quot; long. 2300 cu. in.

The B-1 is a lightweight shoulder pack designed for carrying your
boots, chalk bag, and maybe some water and snacks while bouldering.
The pack body is our ONS Mesh, an extremely tough and durable
fabric that is light in weight and since it is a mesh, lets your
boot stink escape into the atmosphere instantly. A single over
the shoulder strap is provided and is lightly padded with ShamPelt
fur. The top pocket has an outside zipper so you can get to your
tape and tincture before your flapper makes you bleed to death.
The bottom is made from 18oz. VCN fabric for long life. Approximate
size is 2000 cu.in. with a 12&quot; diameter bottom. <B>SOLD OUT</B><BR>
If you would prefer a more tradtional set up, order the <B>B-2
Bouldering Pack</B>, which has all the features of the B-1, but
comes with two shoulder straps instead of the single strap for
over the shoulder <I>chic</I>.SOLD OUT</P>

<P><CENTER><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Crag Pack (just in!!!!)<BR>
</FONT></B>Here is the scoop on these packs.... we were approached
by a MAJOR pack manufacturer to order a run of packs using their
VAST resources. Hmmmmm...... sounded pretty good to me, but all
the samples they had were not exactly what we were looking for.
After a few trial runs and some changes for the better, we were
presented with a 35 litre (that's a lot of beer!) pack with that
&quot;all pro, $125.00 look&quot; that you see in the stores.
Their factory has been making packs for the big name (and big
$$$$) companies for a long time, and the workmanship and features
on this pack shout &quot;pay big bucks!!!&quot;. But, since we
have no middleman, instead of getting the reamer for around $100.00
or more, we can offer these at a great intro price of only $69.00.
This price will be going up to $79.00 in the future, so order
now. Click on a small photo to see all the features. A few highlights:
burly Diamond Grid Cordura body fabric, internal stays, molded
back panel, top and bottom zipper openings, numerous lash straps,
and a &quot;wet or stinky&quot; mesh pocket on the outside rear
of the body. All the packs are dark green and black. <B>SOLD OUT</B>.<A
