here is our effort. Before I start my rant on just why a table

get all huffy because you thought you were a 5.13 guy but now
only boulder V7 instead of V10, read this:</BIG></B></CENTER></P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>V0 </B>A problem you wouldn't admit to doing no matter
  how cool it was.
  <LI><B>V1 </B>A problem you would admit to doing, if it had loose
  holds, a death<BR>
  landing, and your partner backed off of it.
  <LI><B>V2 </B>A problem, if cool enough, that you would recommend
  to others to<BR>
  prove you're not a ratings snob.
  <LI><B>V3 </B>A problem you ruthlessly wire and incorporate into
  your warm-up<BR>
  routine, in the hopes that visiting partners will struggle on
  it.
  <LI><B>V4 </B>A problem that might give you trouble, but &quot;Hey,
  anything below V5 is<BR>
  so easy I can't tell the difference.&quot;
  <LI><B>V5 </B>A problem, if you were to live in Boulder, Colorado,
  that you might<BR>
  actually flash.
  <LI><B>V6 </B>A problem, if you were to live in Boulder, Colorado,
  that you would<BR>
  expect your girlfriend to flash.
  <LI><B>V7 </B>A problem you fell on repeatedly, but really, you
  could have flashed<BR>
  it.
  <LI><B>V8</B> A problem you religiously avoid, because you're
  &quot;saving it for the<BR>
  flash.&quot;
  <LI><B>V9 </B>A problem you have no chance of flashing.
  <LI><B>V10</B> A problem you knew you could have done, even though
  your spotter<BR>
  took 10kg off for you, so you counted it anyway.
  <LI><B>V11</B> A problem, if flashed, that you might get free
  shoes for, but only<BR>
  if you fax the mags this month.
  <LI><B>V12 </B>A problem you would do if only your fingers were
  a bit smaller, your<BR>
  reach a bit longer, your spotter more attentive, the weather
  more<BR>
  amenable, your shoes not so blown out, your elbow not so sore
  from<BR>
  training, the sun not in your eyes, and you didn't eat that funky<BR>
  take-out Chinese the night before.
  <LI><B>V13 </B>A problem commensurate with your well-published
  abilities, that you<BR>
  deserve credit for, even though you didn't do it, because as
  the mags<BR>
  reported, &quot;It was too humid.&quot;
  <LI><B>V14 </B>A problem only Fred Nicole could do, after you
  gave him the beta.

<P><CENTER><B><BIG>Now back to why these tables never really work:</BIG></B><BR>
The basic flaw or real truth of V-grading is it is area specific.
What this means is the system was never envisioned to cross pollinate
with the YDS, Font, J.T. or whatever. As Sherman said in the first
Hueco guide: &quot;The V rating system is an open ended system
for grading boulder problems. It originated in Hueco Tanks.&quot;
He went on to say, &quot; Whether a problem is intimidating, scary,
loose or has a bad landing has no effect on the V grade. Only
the physical difficulty counts, that is the technicality of the
moves combined with the demands on one's power and endurance.&quot;
He added, &quot;...the ratings are consensus of opinions of expert
boulderers in excellent shape, or when lacking a consensus, my
opinion of how hard it felt when I did it.&quot; A sample of boulder
problems followed this advice and listed the standard problems
for each V grade at Hueco, with a few from other areas thrown
in to help those from out of town and clueless. Nowhere did it
say that V4 was 5.12a or any other grade. So, when bouldering
in the Bishop area, use our sample problems for each grade as
your guide to how the area is graded. If you do one of our V4
standards and then do a problem that is easier, it is probably
V3....if it is harder, it is probably V5. If it is 25 feet high
and rated V0, that does not mean it will be easier than a sit
down 5 footer graded V0...it should be just as hard...maybe right
up to the last move. Bad landing? Who cares... V2 is still V2,
whether you are landing on a lawn or Punji sticks.<BR>
Addendum: In the winter of 2000, a stack of Brits were here for
an extended stay. They reworked the chart below to help out with
the Font and Peak grades. These were no ordinary slackers, but
guys and gals who have been pulling hard for years and have a
great experience in all the areas and grades up to V11 or so.
The thing that rang most true was this: If you are used to Hueco
grades (ie: pulling hard, positive holds, power, steep) and go
to the Font, chances are you will get your butt kicked. The Font
is mostly slopers, not so steep, and requires technique. The Peak
is somewhere in the middle, with power problems and slopers in
the mix.</CENTER></P>

are a measuring stick for the size of your ego they are also directly

gives you and how often you get laid.</I> &quot;<BR>
