Maybe, but what is your excuse?

&gt; Remember this simple formula: Impact Force = Distance\\

if you take a 20 foot\\
&gt; fall on ten feet of rope, you get an IF of 2.\\
&gt; If you take a 20 footer and your belayer reels it in to 5
feet of rope, you get\\
&gt; an IF of 2.5.

Non sequitor. First off, impact force and fall factor (what
is described above)\\
are not at all the same thing. It is impossible to generate a
fall factor\\
greater than 2, no matter what you do. (You can't even achieve
2 in the real\\
world but we won't get into that) Think about it. If you have
10 feet of rope\\
out and the belayer takes in 5, you cannot fall 20 feet without
cutting the\\
rope. Impact force is determined by numerous factors including
the amount of\\
rope out, rope characteristics, mass of climber, and quality of
belay.

Why do you think it only survives a certain number of them???

but as\\
&gt;illustrated below\\

No, if you say teh spring can extend infinitely without limit,\\
then you may continue elastic deformation linearly until the fall\\
energy is absorbed. If you consider an elastic limit, the force\\
may curve upward exponetually until you are in a purely plastic\\
region. The force may well exceed the calculations you've done,\\
and the result is that your estimates were NOT conservative.

&gt;As shown below, (QUALITATIVELY), when a material reaches
it's elastic\\
&gt;limit, or yield point, Y, the stress-strain curve levels off.
The slope\\
&gt;of the curve shown below is the material's Modulus of Elasticity,
or the\\
&gt;reciprocal\\
&gt;of the "spring constant" k used in my analysis.
So, as the material\\
&gt;is loaded beyond Y, the change in the slope (modulus) will
result in the\\
&gt;actual forces being less than those calculated using the original\\
&gt;equation.

Just before that point, you may get quite a swell though,\\
Like a function that approaches some huge value (parabolically)

The problem is that much of the "springiness" of
the rope comes\\
NOT from the material, but from the WEAVE. This WEAVE can only\\
re-align so far before it's at it's max.

An example. A BW 10.5mm enduro stretches about 7% under an
80kg\\
mass load ( aprox 170lbf) Do you think that under 1700lbf it will\\
stretch 70%?!?!?!?! Now, what about the 2200 lbf you predicted?\\
Do you think the rope will stretch 91%?!?!? No, it won't.\\
The "spring" gets stiffer as you go, and all linear
approximations are\\
irrelivant and wrong.

&gt;As originally stated, this is a CONSERVATIVE analysis,
and ACTUAL forces\\
&gt;should not exceed the values produced by this equation. This
is not to say\\
&gt;that the effect on the rope is less severe. Exceeding the
elastic limit\\
&gt;means severe damage to the rope, and it should be retired!

Yup. Not that on tests by the UIAA, after the first or second
fall,\\
that the impact forces exceed safe limits.

&gt; (ascii art nice, but not relivant)\\
&gt;\\
&gt;P.S. A interesting thing to note: According to this analysis,
there is no\\
&gt;difference (impact force - wise) between a 2-foot factor-2

We get into system dominant effects. A knot and your body\\
can absorb most of a 2ft fall, but are insugnificant in a 200'
fall.

&gt;Should a rope be retired if one, for example, falls 4 inches
with only 4\\
&gt;inches of rope paid out? THIS IS A FACTOR-2 FALL!!!

No, system domination achieved by spinal compression.\\
I did some rough calculations on this 2 years ago, and again last

|&gt; Thanks Spencer

Reading so much talk on fall factor, whether to run uphill,
downhill,\\
sideways, "what if..." , etc., I was interested to know
if the maximum\\
force in a fall could REALLY be correlated to fall factor. So,
here is\\
my attempt to answer my own question... just thought some of you
may also\\
be interested.

Mathematics of the Fall Factor

This analysis is a simple derivation from first principles
of the maximum\\
force |&gt; generated in a fall as a function of Fall Factor and
other\\
parameters. Several simplifying assumptions are made which include:

* The rope is treated as a simple spring, and no attempt is
made to\\
account for energy absorption in the rope, or dampening, which
really\\
only results in this analysis yielding LARGER than actual maximum
forces.

* Does not account for energy absorbed by either the belayer
or fallen\\
climber, both of which will also reduce the actual maximum forces\\
generated.

Both of the above assumptions make this a CONSERVATIVE analysis,
meaning\\
that actual forces ON THE ROPE will be less than those\\
calculated here. However, these are just the forces on THE ROPE,
not on\\
the pro, and not concentrated by a knot.

The following notations will be used:

L = rope length (rope paid out before stretching)\\
l = rope stretch

S = %stretch = l / L

d = distance of fall, NOT INCLUDING stretch

F = fall factor = d/L

m = mass (of fallen climber)

g = gravitational constant

W = weight of climber = m * g

K = spring constant, force per unit length

k = K / L = spring constant per unit length or force per length
per length

Z = max force

The analysis basically uses the concept of conservation of
energy,\\
assuming that the potential energy difference between two different\\
heights will be equal to the energy stored in the rope (assumed
to behave\\
as a simple spring).

Potential energy = Energy stored in spring

m * g * h = 1/2 * K * x * x

W * (d + l) = 1/2 * (k / L) * l * l (fall + stretch)

W * (d/L + l/L) = 1/2 * k * (l/L) * (l/L)

W * (F + S) = 1/2 * k * S * S

The max force on the rope is Z = K * l = (k / L) * l = k *
S

W * (F + Z/k) = 1/2 * Z * S = 1/2 * Z * Z / k

or

2 * W * F * k + 2 * W * Z = Z * Z

Z * Z - 2 * W * Z - 2 * W * F * k = 0

using binomial equation to solve,

Z = (2 * W +/- sqrt(2W * 2W - 4 * (-2WFk))) / 2

Z = W + sqrt(WW + 2WFk)

So, we have all the necessary information to correllate maximum
force Z to\\
fall factor F, except the spring constant k.

Looking at rope specs in a gear catalog, I found that climbing
ropes\\
stretch anywhere between 4% and 8% under an 80kg load.

therefore, by my notation, k = 80 kg / s, where here lower
case s is %\\
stretch for 80kg.

Z = W + sqrt(WW + 2WF(80 / s))

Z = W + sqrt(WW + 160WF / s)

For an 80kg climber (about 176 pounds) here are some results
from that\\
calculation:

F s Z(kg) Z(lb)

1 8% 488 1073\\
1 4% 651 1433\\
2 8% 651 1433\\
2 4% 884 1945\\
2 2% 1214 2671\\
2 1% 1682 3700\\
2 0.5% 2344 5157

Now a couple of extra comments... notes.

1) As stated, for most dynamic climbing ropes, s=4% to 8%.

2) I have no idea what s is for webbing or static line, but
probably down\\
in the range 1% or less.

3) Once again, this is the force on the rope (or more precisely,
the\\
fallen climber). Knots will concentrate the force.

4) If the climber is belayed through a piece of pro, and assuming
the\\
biner acts as a perfect frictionless pulley (it's really not),
the force\\
on the climber must be opposed by the belayer. Therefore the total
force\\
on the PRO is 2X!. As someone suggested on this thread,\\
ROPES DON'T BREAK! People and placements DO!

Just food for thought

Flames welcome. I'd like to know if I've made any horrible
mistakes.\\
But, I think you'll find that it's equivalent to the formula provided
by\\
ASpencer.

Possible, yes. assuming that the FF= 2.0 was possible to\\

See prior comment. FF = 2.0 shouldn't be happening!

------------------------------Attatched File--------------------------------

Short-Roping the leader (a blue-print for injury).\\
This applies to sport-climbing, primarily, and more to overhangs
than\\
anything else, though the same will be true of dead-vertical climbs.\\
Slightly slabby stuff DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS REASONING.

Simply put:

Given a lead fall of a certain lenght, there are several\\
possibilities. These amounts of "slack" are not the
distance between the\\
climber and last piece of pro. They are the EXTRA rope payed out,
or\\
"looseness" of the system.

#1) No slack in the rope (rope is almost tight before fall).\\
#2) A bit of slack in the rope (say 2').\\
#3) A LOT of slack (say, 5' or more) in the rope.\\
#4) SHORT_ROPING The belayer takes rope or puts on tension before\\
or durring a fall. THIS IS BAD!

In case #2, what you will have under normal circumstances,
the leader falls\\
a bit, and is yanked to a stop below his pro. Normally, this is
not a problem,\\
but may be less than ideal at times, with the leader being swung
into the\\
cliff somewhat.

Case #1 Is not quite short-roping , but is almost as bad. In
this situation,\\
the leader has progressed up what we'll assume to be a constant
incline\\
(overhang, I guess) on the cliff. (s)he is now a certain vertical\\
distance and horizontal distance above the pro. WHen the leader
falls,\\
they will come onto tension just slightly further out than they
started\\
(due to "popping" off of the cliff), then proceed to
be swung/catapoulted\\
into the wall at about the same distance on the other side of
the pro...\\
I.E., right into the cliff. Pull back a swing a certian distance,
it will\\
swing about the same amount the other way. Applies (though not
ideal,\\
probably better than a swing) to climbers as well.

Case #4 Is SHORT_ROPING. The climber ends up falling less PAST
the pro than\\
(s)he started above it. IE, climber is 4' above the pro, and 2'
of rope\\
is taken in. In a high-factor fall, the leader might stop 3' below\\
the pro after rope stretch (2' if you don't count it). Well, let's
say it was\\
a 45 degree angle cliff. Now you're 4' OUT from one side of your
pro, plus\\
a foot or two (we'll say 2) because you "popped"; this
totals a horizontal\\
distance of 6 feet out. The cliff is only 3' on the other side
of the bolt.\\
Guess who gets slammed into the cliff.

It could be worse yet. Say, for example that your belayer DID
put tension\\
on the line as you cruised past the last piece of pro... No you
have an\\
added inward accelleration. DUMB! Smack, evolution isn't always
working\\
like it should. The belayer makes the error, and the leader pays.

SO, the ideal situation could be either #2 or #3. The main
point is that\\
the leader is further than twice the distance from the cliff when
the rope\\
comes tight than (s)he started out horizontally from the pro.

Someone also mentioned jumping out from teh cliff when they
fall. On\\
overhangs and verticals, I'd say it's a raw deal. Don't do it.
You'll\\
get slammed in with an equal amount of energy added. Fall vertically.\\
On slabs, it will "depend" upon the fall. If you think
you can avoid\\
impact that way, go for it, if not, slide!

Obviously, you don't give or allow slack if there is a ledge
coming up.\\
The math was greatly simplified for the sake of brevity. Flame
me if you\\
really want to, but all it's gonna get you is ridicule and possibly
a more\\
elaborate model. Yes, I could do an energy analysis, but it's
gonna yield\\
about the same #'s. Different amounts of overhangs produce the
same effect\\
to varrying degrees, and I'll just let you guys figure out vertical
walls\\
by yourselves (which you are capable of). Swing a pendulum of
given mass\\
and initial horizontal displacement on a long string then a short
string\\
to see what collides more violently with a wall, and you have
a perfect\\
example of what happens on vertical-climbs if short-roped.

Hope this helped, but I know I didn't do the best job explaining
it all.\\
I'll welcome net.discussion on this subject matter (won't fire
the\\
flame thrower up except to retaliate), as I believe it's appropriate\\
material for this news group.

So... Any questions?

I also threaten to savagely flame anyone who gets it wrong.

The simple answer to the questions posed is that despite numerous\\
discussions of the physics of falling on rec.climbing, we don't\\
know. I can assure you that a rope is more complex than a spring.\\
It is also clear that for a given rope, fall force is positively\\
correlated with fall factor, the ratio of distance fallen to length\\
of rope absorbing the fall. Similarly with climber's mass.

Note that ropes absorb energy by several different means, including\\
stretching of individual fibers, tightening of yarns and braids,\\
friction between fibers, and probably others that I have\\
overlooked. Manufacturers design their ropes to act differently
at\\
different loads.

I had requested some information on what a UIAA FALL is and
I had one\\
reply then founf it in a book I had over looked so I thought I
would\\
pass it on .

The drop Test.

In a climber's eyes the drop test is the most critical test
that could\\
be made. This test is designed to simulate a leader fall. The
UIAA\\
measures both the ropes impact force and the number of falles
a rope\\
can with stand.

To conduct the test, The uiaa anchors one end of a 2.8 meter
length of\\
some manufacturers rope, which they run through a carabiner-like\\
device. Next they load its free end with either an 80kg. load
(if\\
they are test a single rope), or a 55kg. loAD (FOR ONE DOUBLE
OR TWIN\\
ROPE). They also test two double and twin ropes at a time, dropping\\
the 80kg. weight.

The anchored end is 0.3m away from the carabiner-like device,
so the\\
actual lenght of the slack rope is 2.5m. The loadis dropped from
this\\
hight, and ends up falling a bit more than 5 meters, due to the
rope's\\
stretch. The result is a fall factor of 1.78.

In order to pass the test, a single rope must have an impact
force of\\
less than 12 kilo newtons, and with stand at least 5 falls befor
it\\
breaks. A double or twin rope must rigister an impact force of
less\\
than 8 kn., and with stand at least 5 falls.

Should read, "In the uneducated climber's eyes..."
Fall ratings are\\
about the least valuable bits of info when deciding on a rope.
Great\\
marketing tool though.

Only the twin, not the half rope.

Close enough. It's really 1.73. Still very severe.

&gt; Any rope manufacturer will tell you that\\

No, they won't. Bluewater has done tests which showed repeated\\
low-factor falls results in significantly lower tensile strength
and\\
higher impact forces. This is something which is not practical
to create\\
a standard for due to the very high costs of testing. There is
also the\\
problem of the sheath wearing out roughly fifteen feet from the
end on\\
ropes used for taking lots of wingers -- hence the reason behind\\
"Program" and gym ropes. Ropes also deteriorate with
age somewhat, even\\
when sitting in a wrapper.

You might educate yourself a bit more before calling everyone
else\\
idiots. There is no easy answer on when to retire your ropes from
lead\\
duty.
