<p>Yeah, really simple, sure. Just do the math, 100's of ignorant<br>

has been very close yet.</p>

<p>Fall factor is not the dominant system in short falls? Know

<p>Maybe, but what is your excuse?</p>

<p>&gt; Remember this simple formula: Impact Force = Distance<br>
&gt; fallen divided by rope paid out. More simply, this means
if you take a 20 foot<br>
&gt; fall on ten feet of rope, you get an IF of 2.<br>
&gt; If you take a 20 footer and your belayer reels it in to 5
feet of rope, you get<br>
&gt; an IF of 2.5.</p>

<p>Non sequitor. First off, impact force and fall factor (what
is described above)<br>
are not at all the same thing. It is impossible to generate a
fall factor<br>
greater than 2, no matter what you do. (You can't even achieve
2 in the real<br>
world but we won't get into that) Think about it. If you have
10 feet of rope<br>
out and the belayer takes in 5, you cannot fall 20 feet without
cutting the<br>
rope. Impact force is determined by numerous factors including
the amount of<br>
rope out, rope characteristics, mass of climber, and quality of
belay.</p>

<p>Why do you think it only survives a certain number of them???</p>

but as<br>
&gt;illustrated below<br>

<p>No, if you say teh spring can extend infinitely without limit,<br>
then you may continue elastic deformation linearly until the fall<br>
energy is absorbed. If you consider an elastic limit, the force<br>
may curve upward exponetually until you are in a purely plastic<br>
region. The force may well exceed the calculations you've done,<br>
and the result is that your estimates were NOT conservative.</p>

<p>&gt;As shown below, (QUALITATIVELY), when a material reaches
it's elastic<br>
&gt;limit, or yield point, Y, the stress-strain curve levels off.
The slope<br>
&gt;of the curve shown below is the material's Modulus of Elasticity,
or the<br>
&gt;reciprocal<br>
&gt;of the "spring constant" k used in my analysis.
So, as the material<br>
&gt;is loaded beyond Y, the change in the slope (modulus) will
result in the<br>
&gt;actual forces being less than those calculated using the original<br>
&gt;equation.</p>

<p>Just before that point, you may get quite a swell though,<br>
Like a function that approaches some huge value (parabolically)</p>

<p>The problem is that much of the "springiness" of
the rope comes<br>
NOT from the material, but from the WEAVE. This WEAVE can only<br>
re-align so far before it's at it's max.</p>

<p>An example. A BW 10.5mm enduro stretches about 7% under an
80kg<br>
mass load ( aprox 170lbf) Do you think that under 1700lbf it will<br>
stretch 70%?!?!?!?! Now, what about the 2200 lbf you predicted?<br>
Do you think the rope will stretch 91%?!?!? No, it won't.<br>
The "spring" gets stiffer as you go, and all linear
approximations are<br>
irrelivant and wrong.</p>

<p>&gt;As originally stated, this is a CONSERVATIVE analysis,
and ACTUAL forces<br>
&gt;should not exceed the values produced by this equation. This
is not to say<br>
&gt;that the effect on the rope is less severe. Exceeding the
elastic limit<br>
&gt;means severe damage to the rope, and it should be retired!</p>

<p>Yup. Not that on tests by the UIAA, after the first or second
fall,<br>
that the impact forces exceed safe limits.</p>

<p>&gt; (ascii art nice, but not relivant)<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;P.S. A interesting thing to note: According to this analysis,
there is no<br>
&gt;difference (impact force - wise) between a 2-foot factor-2
fall and a<br>
&gt;160-foot factor-2 fall, or a 2-inch factor-2 fall!</p>

<p>We get into system dominant effects. A knot and your body<br>
can absorb most of a 2ft fall, but are insugnificant in a 200'
fall.</p>

<p>&gt;Should a rope be retired if one, for example, falls 4 inches
with only 4<br>
&gt;inches of rope paid out? THIS IS A FACTOR-2 FALL!!!</p>

<p>No, system domination achieved by spinal compression.<br>
I did some rough calculations on this 2 years ago, and again last
fall.<br>
They were posted.</p>

to use this<br>
|&gt; formula in a spread sheet. It may help others understand

<p>|&gt; Thanks Spencer</p>

<p>Reading so much talk on fall factor, whether to run uphill,
downhill,<br>
sideways, "what if..." , etc., I was interested to know
if the maximum<br>
force in a fall could REALLY be correlated to fall factor. So,
here is<br>
my attempt to answer my own question... just thought some of you
may also<br>
be interested.</p>

<p>Mathematics of the Fall Factor</p>

<p>This analysis is a simple derivation from first principles
of the maximum<br>
force |&gt; generated in a fall as a function of Fall Factor and
other<br>
parameters. Several simplifying assumptions are made which include:</p>

<p>* The rope is treated as a simple spring, and no attempt is
made to<br>
account for energy absorption in the rope, or dampening, which
really<br>
only results in this analysis yielding LARGER than actual maximum
forces.</p>

<p>* Does not account for energy absorbed by either the belayer
or fallen<br>
climber, both of which will also reduce the actual maximum forces<br>
generated.</p>

<p>Both of the above assumptions make this a CONSERVATIVE analysis,
meaning<br>
that actual forces ON THE ROPE will be less than those<br>
calculated here. However, these are just the forces on THE ROPE,
not on<br>
the pro, and not concentrated by a knot.</p>

<p>The following notations will be used:</p>

<p>L = rope length (rope paid out before stretching)<br>
l = rope stretch</p>

<p>S = %stretch = l / L</p>

<p>d = distance of fall, NOT INCLUDING stretch</p>

<p>F = fall factor = d/L</p>

<p>m = mass (of fallen climber)</p>

<p>g = gravitational constant</p>

<p>W = weight of climber = m * g</p>

<p>K = spring constant, force per unit length</p>

<p>k = K / L = spring constant per unit length or force per length
per length</p>

<p>Z = max force</p>

<p>The analysis basically uses the concept of conservation of
energy,<br>
assuming that the potential energy difference between two different<br>
heights will be equal to the energy stored in the rope (assumed
to behave<br>
as a simple spring).</p>

<p>Potential energy = Energy stored in spring</p>

<p>m * g * h = 1/2 * K * x * x</p>

<p>W * (d + l) = 1/2 * (k / L) * l * l (fall + stretch)</p>

<p>W * (d/L + l/L) = 1/2 * k * (l/L) * (l/L)</p>

<p>W * (F + S) = 1/2 * k * S * S</p>

<p>The max force on the rope is Z = K * l = (k / L) * l = k *
S</p>

<p>W * (F + Z/k) = 1/2 * Z * S = 1/2 * Z * Z / k</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2 * W * F * k + 2 * W * Z = Z * Z</p>

<p>Z * Z - 2 * W * Z - 2 * W * F * k = 0</p>

<p>using binomial equation to solve,</p>

<p>Z = (2 * W +/- sqrt(2W * 2W - 4 * (-2WFk))) / 2</p>

<p>Z = W + sqrt(WW + 2WFk)</p>

<p>So, we have all the necessary information to correllate maximum
force Z to<br>
fall factor F, except the spring constant k.</p>

<p>Looking at rope specs in a gear catalog, I found that climbing
ropes<br>
stretch anywhere between 4% and 8% under an 80kg load.</p>

<p>therefore, by my notation, k = 80 kg / s, where here lower
case s is %<br>
stretch for 80kg.</p>

<p>Z = W + sqrt(WW + 2WF(80 / s))</p>

<p>Z = W + sqrt(WW + 160WF / s)</p>

<p>For an 80kg climber (about 176 pounds) here are some results
from that<br>
calculation:</p>

<p>F s Z(kg) Z(lb)</p>

<p>1 8% 488 1073<br>
1 4% 651 1433<br>
2 8% 651 1433<br>
2 4% 884 1945<br>
2 2% 1214 2671<br>
2 1% 1682 3700<br>
2 0.5% 2344 5157</p>

<p>Now a couple of extra comments... notes.</p>

<p>1) As stated, for most dynamic climbing ropes, s=4% to 8%.</p>

<p>2) I have no idea what s is for webbing or static line, but
probably down<br>
in the range 1% or less.</p>

<p>3) Once again, this is the force on the rope (or more precisely,
the<br>
fallen climber). Knots will concentrate the force.</p>

<p>4) If the climber is belayed through a piece of pro, and assuming
the<br>
biner acts as a perfect frictionless pulley (it's really not),
the force<br>
on the climber must be opposed by the belayer. Therefore the total
force<br>
on the PRO is 2X!. As someone suggested on this thread,<br>
ROPES DON'T BREAK! People and placements DO!</p>

<p>Just food for thought</p>

<p>Flames welcome. I'd like to know if I've made any horrible
mistakes.<br>
But, I think you'll find that it's equivalent to the formula provided
by<br>
ASpencer.</p>

Why is Clyde wrong?<br>

<p>Chuck Replied:<br>
Taking in rope during a fall will reduce the amount of rope available
to<br>
absorb the fall but it will also reduce the length of the fall.<br>
If you are expecting a fall of less then factor 1.0, taking in
rope will<br>
reduce the fall factor.<br>
If you are expecting a fall of factor 1.0, taking in rope will
have no<br>
effect on the fall factor.<br>
If you are expecting a fall of more then factor 1.0, taking in
rope will<br>
increase the fall factor.<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Essentailly the thread we had 2 months ago. Genearlly<br>
correct, but again, TAKING IN rope is NOT the same as<br>
RUNNING with it. (Which was the issue at hand.) You<br>
aren't setting a large inertia in motoin the other way...<br>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
This analysis is _SOOOO_ wrong, I am not even going to<br>
bother with it point by point. Just ignore it. It is<br>
flawed in every fundimental sense possible.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
&gt;Any impact force of more than 1.5 can cause whiplash or break
a few bones of<br>
&gt;the climber, as well a rip gear right out.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
First of, all you're talking FALL FACTOR, not impact force.<br>
Not! If the rope has not lost dynamic charactoristics, it<br>
should not be as severe as implied. UIAA dictates that a<br>
rope must survive the FF= 1.78 without a max impact force<br>
over what a human can survive. That's not to say injuries<br>
can't happen, but really...<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
&gt;Shortening rope is a Bad Idea, period. You should be placing

<p>SOmeone else replied:<br>
a common mistake in several of the responses in this thread is
the thinking<br>
that running downhill shortens the rope length. It doesn't! Only
taking in<br>
rope through your belay device can shorten the rope. Think about
it a little.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Amen. Don't confuse the two... inertial diffs. again.<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
&gt;The old "dynamic hip belay" of pre-belay device
times was safer in terms of<br>
&gt;impact force generated. This involved feeding rope out, not
shortening it.<br>
&gt;Summary: DON'T shorten rope, run downhill, etc. You will probably
cause more<br>
&gt;harm by doing this.<br>

There is a second issue being ignored. The attached file at the<br>

I think your right. Suppose you're 10 feet up from the belay and<br>
fall. The belayer is on top of things and decides to take in as
much rope<br>
as possible before you weight the rope. Suppose he takes in 3
feet. The<br>

to the end<br>
of the rope. He has taken a 17 foot fall and there is only 7 feet

out when the fall stops. Fall factor = 17/7 = 2.43. Is this right?</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Possible, yes. assuming that the FF= 2.0 was possible to<br>
start with. How were you belaying in the first place though???<br>

This applies to sport-climbing, primarily, and more to overhangs
than<br>
anything else, though the same will be true of dead-vertical climbs.<br>
Slightly slabby stuff DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS REASONING.</p>

<p>Simply put:</p>

<p>Given a lead fall of a certain lenght, there are several<br>
possibilities. These amounts of "slack" are not the
distance between the<br>
climber and last piece of pro. They are the EXTRA rope payed out,
or<br>
"looseness" of the system.</p>

<p>#1) No slack in the rope (rope is almost tight before fall).<br>
#2) A bit of slack in the rope (say 2').<br>
#3) A LOT of slack (say, 5' or more) in the rope.<br>
#4) SHORT_ROPING The belayer takes rope or puts on tension before<br>
or durring a fall. THIS IS BAD!</p>

<p>In case #2, what you will have under normal circumstances,
the leader falls<br>
a bit, and is yanked to a stop below his pro. Normally, this is
not a problem,<br>
but may be less than ideal at times, with the leader being swung
into the<br>
cliff somewhat.</p>

<p>Case #1 Is not quite short-roping , but is almost as bad. In
this situation,<br>
the leader has progressed up what we'll assume to be a constant
incline<br>
(overhang, I guess) on the cliff. (s)he is now a certain vertical<br>
distance and horizontal distance above the pro. WHen the leader
falls,<br>
they will come onto tension just slightly further out than they
started<br>
(due to "popping" off of the cliff), then proceed to
be swung/catapoulted<br>
into the wall at about the same distance on the other side of
the pro...<br>
I.E., right into the cliff. Pull back a swing a certian distance,
it will<br>
swing about the same amount the other way. Applies (though not
ideal,<br>
probably better than a swing) to climbers as well.</p>

<p>Case #4 Is SHORT_ROPING. The climber ends up falling less PAST
the pro than<br>
(s)he started above it. IE, climber is 4' above the pro, and 2'
of rope<br>
is taken in. In a high-factor fall, the leader might stop 3' below<br>
the pro after rope stretch (2' if you don't count it). Well, let's
say it was<br>
a 45 degree angle cliff. Now you're 4' OUT from one side of your
pro, plus<br>
a foot or two (we'll say 2) because you "popped"; this
totals a horizontal<br>
distance of 6 feet out. The cliff is only 3' on the other side
of the bolt.<br>
Guess who gets slammed into the cliff.</p>

<p>It could be worse yet. Say, for example that your belayer DID
put tension<br>
on the line as you cruised past the last piece of pro... No you
have an<br>
added inward accelleration. DUMB! Smack, evolution isn't always
working<br>
like it should. The belayer makes the error, and the leader pays.</p>

<p>SO, the ideal situation could be either #2 or #3. The main
point is that<br>
the leader is further than twice the distance from the cliff when
the rope<br>
comes tight than (s)he started out horizontally from the pro.</p>

<p>Someone also mentioned jumping out from teh cliff when they
fall. On<br>
overhangs and verticals, I'd say it's a raw deal. Don't do it.
You'll<br>
get slammed in with an equal amount of energy added. Fall vertically.<br>
On slabs, it will "depend" upon the fall. If you think
you can avoid<br>
impact that way, go for it, if not, slide!</p>

<p>Obviously, you don't give or allow slack if there is a ledge
coming up.<br>
The math was greatly simplified for the sake of brevity. Flame
me if you<br>
really want to, but all it's gonna get you is ridicule and possibly
a more<br>
elaborate model. Yes, I could do an energy analysis, but it's
gonna yield<br>
about the same #'s. Different amounts of overhangs produce the
same effect<br>
to varrying degrees, and I'll just let you guys figure out vertical
walls<br>
by yourselves (which you are capable of). Swing a pendulum of
given mass<br>
and initial horizontal displacement on a long string then a short
string<br>
to see what collides more violently with a wall, and you have
a perfect<br>
example of what happens on vertical-climbs if short-roped.</p>

<p>Hope this helped, but I know I didn't do the best job explaining
it all.<br>
I'll welcome net.discussion on this subject matter (won't fire
the<br>
flame thrower up except to retaliate), as I believe it's appropriate<br>
material for this news group.</p>

<p>So... Any questions?</p>

<p>-T.</p>

<p>The simple answer to the questions posed is that despite numerous<br>
discussions of the physics of falling on rec.climbing, we don't<br>
know. I can assure you that a rope is more complex than a spring.<br>
It is also clear that for a given rope, fall force is positively<br>
correlated with fall factor, the ratio of distance fallen to length<br>
of rope absorbing the fall. Similarly with climber's mass.</p>

<p>Note that ropes absorb energy by several different means, including<br>
stretching of individual fibers, tightening of yarns and braids,<br>
friction between fibers, and probably others that I have<br>
overlooked. Manufacturers design their ropes to act differently
at<br>
different loads.</p>

<p>I had requested some information on what a UIAA FALL is and
I had one<br>
reply then founf it in a book I had over looked so I thought I
would<br>
pass it on .</p>

<p>The drop Test.</p>

<p>In a climber's eyes the drop test is the most critical test
that could<br>
be made. This test is designed to simulate a leader fall. The
UIAA<br>
measures both the ropes impact force and the number of falles
a rope<br>
can with stand.</p>

<p>To conduct the test, The uiaa anchors one end of a 2.8 meter
length of<br>
some manufacturers rope, which they run through a carabiner-like<br>
device. Next they load its free end with either an 80kg. load
(if<br>
they are test a single rope), or a 55kg. loAD (FOR ONE DOUBLE
OR TWIN<br>
ROPE). They also test two double and twin ropes at a time, dropping<br>
the 80kg. weight.</p>

<p>The anchored end is 0.3m away from the carabiner-like device,
so the<br>
actual lenght of the slack rope is 2.5m. The loadis dropped from
this<br>
hight, and ends up falling a bit more than 5 meters, due to the
rope's<br>
stretch. The result is a fall factor of 1.78.</p>

<p>In order to pass the test, a single rope must have an impact
force of<br>
less than 12 kilo newtons, and with stand at least 5 falls befor
it<br>
breaks. A double or twin rope must rigister an impact force of
less<br>
than 8 kn., and with stand at least 5 falls.</p>

<p>Should read, "In the uneducated climber's eyes..."
Fall ratings are<br>
about the least valuable bits of info when deciding on a rope.
Great<br>
marketing tool though.</p>

<p>Only the twin, not the half rope.</p>

<p>Close enough. It's really 1.73. Still very severe.</p>

<p>&gt; Any rope manufacturer will tell you that<br>

<p>No, they won't. Bluewater has done tests which showed repeated<br>
low-factor falls results in significantly lower tensile strength
and<br>
higher impact forces. This is something which is not practical
to create<br>
a standard for due to the very high costs of testing. There is
also the<br>
problem of the sheath wearing out roughly fifteen feet from the
end on<br>
ropes used for taking lots of wingers -- hence the reason behind<br>
"Program" and gym ropes. Ropes also deteriorate with
age somewhat, even<br>
when sitting in a wrapper.</p>

<p>You might educate yourself a bit more before calling everyone
else<br>
idiots. There is no easy answer on when to retire your ropes from
lead<br>
duty.</p>
