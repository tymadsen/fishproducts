<p><b><font size="+1">Re: BD Stoppers--Bounce Test Data</font></b></p>

<p>From - Tue Feb 16 14:36:39 1999<br>
  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;<br>
Newsgroups: rec.climbing</p>

<p>I have measured forces up to 1000 lbf while bounce testing.
I was using<br>
BD Etriers and bounced with about a six inch free fall bounce.
It is easy<br>
to break small Stoppers if vigorously bounce testing. I weigh
190 lb.</p>

<p>I have seen several small stoppers break in the field due to
bounce<br>
testing and due to lead falls.</p>

<p>Rated strengths are stated as 3 sigma failure loads. There
is not a 20 to<br>
30% buffer. They break close to what they are rated. 3 Sigma is
three<br>
standard deviations below the average breaking strength. Average
batch<br>
test results (n = 10) range from 600 to 700 lbf for #1 and #2
Stoppers.<br>
Batch standard deviations range from 6 lb to 50 lb. When combined
into a<br>
years worth of data our rating computes to 450 lbf. The weakest
sample I<br>
have seen in the last year failed at 535 lbf. The strongest failed
at 808<br>
lbf. 3 Sigma means that there is a 99.87% chance that the sample
will be<br>
stronger than the rating. This also means that there is a 0.13%
chance<br>
that a sample will fail below the rating. All this data is for
brand new<br>
equipment that has never seen any fatigue due to placement, removal,<br>
falling on, bouncing on, etc. These small units get worn fairly
quickly<br>
and can break eventually. Inspect your gear often. If you have
to use<br>
these for lead protection then follow the advice of most of this
group.<br>
Back them up. Sometimes the only option you have is a small nut.
Better<br>
than nothing in many situations. Beware of the limitations of
your gear<br>
though. Chris</p>

&gt;&gt; &gt; Catalog say 2kN or 450 lbf for #1 &amp; #2. Not
hard to generate this kind of<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; load in a fall.<br>
&gt;&gt; That's an understatement. My body weight is close to
1 KN.<br>
&gt;&gt; Just jumping up and down I can generate about 2 KN.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Ooh, a verifiable experiment. I like it. How about you try
it out?<br>
&gt;I've always wondered how much force a bounce test really generates.<br>
&gt;Clip a biner to a bolt low to the ground. Slide the head down
a #1 stopper.<br>
&gt;Clip one end to the bolt biner. Clip an aider or sling to
the other end.<br>
&gt;Don safety glasses. Bounce. See if you can break it. I'm really
curious.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;Off the top of my head, I'm betting biner flex, aider stretch,
etc. will<br>
&gt;prevent breakage. Time to find myself a low bolt, though my
weight is only<br>
&gt;around 0.73kN.<br>

<p><b><font size="+1">Rivet Hanger question</font></b></p>

<p>Russ Walling writes to Chris Harmston @ BD:</p>

<p>&gt;Not sure if you have seen these rivet hangers guys are
making now where<br>
&gt;it is a self tightening loop that goes around the rivet. Like
a cinch<br>
&gt;loop in the end of a cable strand, formed by backtracking
through a<br>
&gt;swage sleeve, that then goes to a clip in loop. Our tests
show them as<br>
&gt;being a bit suspect. I don't like the way the stop on the
cinching<br>
&gt;end butts up against the sleeve used to contain the two wires.
It seems<br>
&gt;that the strength of the unit is dependent on the cross or
tearing<br>
&gt;strength of the keeper sleeve instead of the cable strength.
There<br>
&gt;seems to be a lot going on including deformation of the sleeve
and the<br>
&gt;stop sleeve. Whaddya think? <br>
<br>
Chris replies:<br>
Sounds funky. I have never used anything except small Stoppers
for<br>
rivets. I have not seen this device you are talking about. I think
I<br>
understand and it sounds funky to me as well. What kind of testing
have<br>
you done? If you want me to test some things I can help out (I
have no<br>
idea what kinds of testing capabilities you have). <br>
Later. Chris</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Rivet Hanger question, the test.</font></b></p>

<p>Chris at BD writes:<br>
I have completed the testing. Interesting.</p>

<p>Your standard rivet hangers are identical to loops. The cinch
hangers are<br>
half as strong as your standards. I will send you a copy of the
test<br>
report in the mail.</p>

<p>Quick summary.</p>

<p>Average data:</p>

<p>Loop #1 886 #2 1649 #3 2867 #5 2821<br>
Std. #1 902 #2 1655 #3 2838<br>
Cinch #1 577 #2 1034 #3 1453</p>

<p>Standard deviations range from 12 to 115 throughout all groups.</p>

<p>Overall these can all hold bodyweight and moderate bounce testing.
I<br>
would be a bit worried about bounce testing the #1 cinch. I certainly<br>
would not want to fall on any of the #1's or the #2 cinch. These
are<br>
pretty strong overall though. Even the weakest are comparable
to the<br>
bending strength of most specialty small hooks.</p>

<p>Why would you want the largest cable sizes for rivet hangers?
My guess is<br>
that if you have a large enough rivet or bolt head you can get
a stronger<br>
piece of pro. The very few rivets I have seen would not be able
to accept<br>
the larger diameter cable???</p>

<p>It seems that there may be an advantage to the cinch type.
They will not<br>
allow the moving swage to release too easily. It seems to me that
there<br>
is an increased risk on the standard design for the swage to slip
down and<br>
increase the chances that the hanger will fall off the piece.
I have<br>
never used anything except small stoppers for this and have not
had any<br>
fall off either. I would be interested in your comments on these.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

&gt;These are close to the numbers I got. We rate<br>
&gt;the #1 at 700, the #2 at 1500, and the #3 at 2300. Of course,
YMMV. We never<br>
