**Re: BD Stoppers--Bounce Test Data**

From - Tue Feb 16 14:36:39 1999\\
  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing

I have measured forces up to 1000 lbf while bounce testing.
I was using\\
BD Etriers and bounced with about a six inch free fall bounce.
It is easy\\
to break small Stoppers if vigorously bounce testing. I weigh
190 lb.

I have seen several small stoppers break in the field due to
bounce\\
testing and due to lead falls.

Rated strengths are stated as 3 sigma failure loads. There
is not a 20 to\\
30% buffer. They break close to what they are rated. 3 Sigma is
three\\
standard deviations below the average breaking strength. Average
batch\\
test results (n = 10) range from 600 to 700 lbf for #1 and #2
Stoppers.\\
Batch standard deviations range from 6 lb to 50 lb. When combined
into a\\
years worth of data our rating computes to 450 lbf. The weakest
sample I\\
have seen in the last year failed at 535 lbf. The strongest failed
at 808\\
lbf. 3 Sigma means that there is a 99.87% chance that the sample
will be\\
stronger than the rating. This also means that there is a 0.13%
chance\\
that a sample will fail below the rating. All this data is for
brand new\\
equipment that has never seen any fatigue due to placement, removal,\\
falling on, bouncing on, etc. These small units get worn fairly
quickly\\
and can break eventually. Inspect your gear often. If you have
to use\\
these for lead protection then follow the advice of most of this
group.\\
Back them up. Sometimes the only option you have is a small nut.
Better\\
than nothing in many situations. Beware of the limitations of
your gear\\
though. Chris

a #1 stopper.\\

curious.\\

&gt;Off the top of my head, I'm betting biner flex, aider stretch,

weight is only\\

**Rivet Hanger question**

Russ Walling writes to Chris Harmston @ BD:

&gt;Not sure if you have seen these rivet hangers guys are
making now where\\
&gt;it is a self tightening loop that goes around the rivet. Like
a cinch\\
&gt;loop in the end of a cable strand, formed by backtracking
through a\\
&gt;swage sleeve, that then goes to a clip in loop. Our tests
show them as\\
&gt;being a bit suspect. I don't like the way the stop on the
cinching\\
&gt;end butts up against the sleeve used to contain the two wires.
It seems\\
&gt;that the strength of the unit is dependent on the cross or
tearing\\
&gt;strength of the keeper sleeve instead of the cable strength.
There\\
&gt;seems to be a lot going on including deformation of the sleeve
and the\\
&gt;stop sleeve. Whaddya think? \\
\\
Chris replies:\\
Sounds funky. I have never used anything except small Stoppers
for\\
rivets. I have not seen this device you are talking about. I think
I\\
understand and it sounds funky to me as well. What kind of testing
have\\
you done? If you want me to test some things I can help out (I
have no\\
idea what kinds of testing capabilities you have). \\
Later. Chris

**Rivet Hanger question, the test.**

Chris at BD writes:\\
I have completed the testing. Interesting.

Your standard rivet hangers are identical to loops. The cinch
hangers are\\
half as strong as your standards. I will send you a copy of the
test\\
report in the mail.

Quick summary.

Average data:

Loop #1 886 #2 1649 #3 2867 #5 2821\\
Std. #1 902 #2 1655 #3 2838\\
Cinch #1 577 #2 1034 #3 1453

Standard deviations range from 12 to 115 throughout all groups.

Overall these can all hold bodyweight and moderate bounce testing.
I\\
would be a bit worried about bounce testing the #1 cinch. I certainly\\
would not want to fall on any of the #1's or the #2 cinch. These
are\\
pretty strong overall though. Even the weakest are comparable
to the\\
bending strength of most specialty small hooks.

Why would you want the largest cable sizes for rivet hangers?
My guess is\\
that if you have a large enough rivet or bolt head you can get
a stronger\\
piece of pro. The very few rivets I have seen would not be able
to accept\\
the larger diameter cable???

It seems that there may be an advantage to the cinch type.
They will not\\
allow the moving swage to release too easily. It seems to me that
there\\
is an increased risk on the standard design for the swage to slip
down and\\
increase the chances that the hanger will fall off the piece.
I have\\
never used anything except small stoppers for this and have not
had any\\
fall off either. I would be interested in your comments on these.

Hope this helps.
