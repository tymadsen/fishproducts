    </a>To see something truly amazing, click on the photo above. This collection is owned by Marty Karabin of Phoenix Az. He tells me he has 400 different bolt hangers, 140 different bolts, 50 different hand drills, 300 home made anchor pieces, and 130 different hooks, and even more not on this display! When the display is finished, it will be housed in a 4ft X 38ft. shrine. WOW!
    <br>(my personal fave is the grappling hook on the right middle area.)</center>

<p><b>Stainless Steel bolts</b>
    <br>From - Sept. 09.99
    <br>Newsgroups: rec.climbing
    <br>
    <br>Thor Lancelot Simon wrote:
    <br>N.B. I am *not* a metallurgist or an engineer. I've just been reading
    <br>a lot of stainless steel reference books this afternoon.</p>

<p>Various people have been wondering about failures of relatively new
    <br>stainless bolts in sea cliffs. After a quick glance at the Rawl
    <br>catalog and some quick research, I'm not sure this surprises me.</p>

<p>Rawl gives material types for stainless blue-collar bolts (actually,
    <br>they're now called "Power-Bolts") as:</p>

<p>Internal Bolt: Type 303/4
    <br>Washer: Type 18/8
    <br>Expansion Sleeve: Type 304
    <br>Expansion Cone: Type 303</p>

<p>A few people have suggested that galvanic corrosion between different
    <br>grades of stainless (e.g. a hanger made from Type 316 and a bolt like
    <br>the Rawl made from type 303, or its 18/8 washer) might be problematic.</p>

<p>I'm not a metallurgist so I'm not going to pretend I know about this;
    <br>I haven't found any convenient source of information on which types
    <br>of stainless steel may or may not be safely mated. One would presume,
    <br>however, that Rawl selected grades for the bolt itself which could be
    <br>mated safely (the "18/8" above appears to specify any 301/302/303/304
    <br>series stainless steel with approximately 18% Cr and 8% Ni). Most
    <br>hangers appear to be either Type 304 or Type 316.</p>

<p>However, a quick look at http://www.assdn.asn.au (the Australian
    <br>Stainless Steel Development Association) yields the following
    <br>information about the steel used in the Rawl bolts:</p>

<p>&gt; A compromise between desirable properties of certain grades may be
    <br>&gt; necessary. For example, grade S30300 (austenitic steel known as
    <br>&gt; 303) has excellent machinability, but the high sulphur content
    <br>&gt; which dramatically increases the cutting speed also substantially
    <br>&gt; reduces the grade's weldability, formability and corrosion resistance
    <br>&gt; (its PRE is wrong because the negative effect of sulphur is omitted,
    <br>&gt; making it totally inappropriate for applications where there is a
    <br>&gt; likelihood of corrosive conditions of even a mild nature).</p>

<p>Type 303 is one of the two types listed by Rawl as alternately used
    <br>in the inner bolt (the main load-bearing component!) of the assembly.</p>

<p>The other one is Type 304. But 304 is harder to work, so there's at
    <br>least a decent chance that any random box of Rawl bolts you pick up
    <br>has a Type 303 inner bolt:</p>

<p>&gt; Machinability of 304 is lower than most carbon steels. The standard
    <br>&gt; austenitic grades like 304 can be readily machined, provided that
    <br>&gt; slower speeds and heavy feeds are used, tools are rigid and sharp,
    <br>&gt; and cutting fluids are used. An 'improved machinability' version
    <br>&gt; of 304 also exists.</p>

<p>In any event, 304 is _also_ not the usual choice for a marine (e.g.
    <br>a sea-cliff) environment:</p>

<p>&gt; Alternative grades to 304 should be considered in certain environments
    <br>&gt; and applications, including marine conditions, environments with
    <br>&gt; temperatures above 50-60C and with chlorides present, and applications
    <br>&gt; requiring heavy section welding, substantial machining, high strength
    <br>&gt; or hardness, or strip with very high cold-rolled strength.</p>

<p>Type 316 is listed as "standard for marine fittings". Its typical
    <br>cost is given as $6 (australian) per pound compared to the $5 per
    <br>pound of the more common Type 304 (which is evidently the world's
    <br>standard stainless steel for most purposes). Some Rawl anchors are
    <br>available in Type 316, but at least according to the online catalog,
    <br>the blue collar is *not*. None of the other bolt manufacturers with
    <br>products in common use for rock climbing anchors (Petzl, Fixe) list
    <br>the type of stainless steel used in their bolts; I do have some Kong
    <br>hangers here which are marked "316".</p>

<p>However, it seems that Type 316 may *also* not be appropriate for
    <br>use as an anchor bolt in a sea cliff (particularly the often-soaked
    <br>limestone ones where some recent failures have occurred because of
    <br>problems with stress-corrosion craking under tensile load):</p>

<p>&gt; Common austenitic grades (e.g. S30400 and S31600) may suffer from
    <br>&gt; stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in chloride-containing environments,
    <br>&gt; particularly in temperatures above about 50C and when a tensile
    <br>&gt; stress is present in the steel. The ferritic and duplex grades are
    <br>&gt; highly resistant, though not immune, and should be selected if SCC
    <br>&gt; is a possibility.</p>

<p>That is, they recommend against using *either* 304 or 316 in a
    <br>chloride-containing environment under tensile load (like, say, a
    <br>hanging belay anchor on a popular route on a Thai sea cliff) and
    <br>particularly in hot (okay, very very hot, but every bit can't
    <br>help, and some of the stainless bolt failures heard of recently
    <br>_have_ occurred in tropical, salty places) conditions. This type of
    <br>stress-corrosion cracking could presumably let the shaft of a bolt
    <br>snap off without visible surface corrosion on the bolt head, washer
    <br>or hanger. Ugly, huh?</p>

<p>The upshot? It seems to me that *all* currently-available stainless
    <br>and nonstainless bolts are unsuitable for climbing anchor purposes on
    <br>many (perhaps only those with porous rock?) sea cliffs. Furthermore,
    <br>it seems possible that this will only be rectified if some manufacturer
    <br>can be convinced to build a special-purpose anchor for these
    <br>environments. Rawl will fabricate bolts in any steel desired for an
    <br>order of sufficient quantity, says their catalog, but I doubt this is
    <br>cheap -- the duplex and "super austentic" stainless alloys used for
    <br>high tensile load under marine conditions appear to cost a lot more
    <br>than 304 or 316, and then there's the issue of just how many you'd
    <br>have to buy...</p>

<p>Stress-corrosion cracking can lead to failure under very small loads
    <br>(e.g. body weight) -- if I recall correctly, this was also the issue
    <br>with that bad batch of Leeper hangers people have been trying to
    <br>replace for a few years now. Be very careful on seaside crags -- that
    <br>"bomber" bolt you're looking up at might be about to break in two
    <br>when you rest on it...</p>

<p>At Acadia National Park, there are permanent toprope anchors made from
    <br>glued-in 1" stainless bar stock. It sure seemed like overkill last
    <br>time I saw it, but now I'm thinking other areas might want to consider
    <br>something similar for toprope/belay anchors, unless/until stainless
    <br>bolts made from appropriate materials become available.

    <br>&gt; &gt;&gt;They are quite shallow, and very weak. Numerous
    <br>&gt; &gt;&gt; instances of failures have been recorded. In other words, they're

    <br>&gt; &gt;They're made of inferior metal. Might even be zinc- can't remember.

<p>Say yo,
    <br>The Z-Mac is a Rawl product and is shit as stated. Here is some numbers
    <br>and facts to back it up.....
    <br>Made of: Zmac 7 Alloy with a zinc plated steel of stainless steel
    <br>nail. Zmac Alloy is a special zinc alloy developed for its resistance
    <br>to corrosion. The expansion device is a nail which can be supplied in
    <br>either zinc plated steel or 304 stainless steel, depending on the
    <br>corrosion resistance required. They are manufactured in a msuhroom head
    <br>and flat head configurations.
    <br>Load capacities in 4000psi concrete: 1/4" X 7/8" imbedded, 820lbs
    <br>pullout, 1500lbs shear. Rawl says these are the ultimate load
    <br>capacities, and should be reduced by a factor of 4 or greater to
    <br>determine the allowable working load.
    <br>How to tell the diff?: A standard Rawl buttonhead botl has no nail in
    <br>the middle of the head and is a one piece anchor. A Zmac has a hole in
    <br>the head with a different colored pin in the center. A standard "dowel"
    <br>(also shit) is similar in look to a Zmac, but has an irregular mushroom
    <br>head and no hole in the center with a nail going through it. A rivet
    <br>(machine bolt) has a hex head, and a Zmac does not. Hmmm... what
    <br>else..... A Zmac will often look dark and droopy in the hole, becasue
    <br>they bend easily and are ready to fall out. A RedHead anchor is similar
    <br>to a Zmac, but will oftentimes have a red nail instead of a steel
    <br>colored one... still suspect, but better than a Zmac. Anything with
    <br>threads visible above or below the hole is not a Zmac.
    <br>That should probably give you some idea of what you are clipping.
    <br>adios,

<p>There seems to be some debate as to the benefits of sealing protection
    <br>bolts in the rock with silicone rubber.
    <br>One camp says it is a good idea to keep water (and corrosion) out of the
    <br>bolt hole so it is good to seal the hole with silicone rubber.
    <br>The other camp says it is a bad idea because it keeps the water that seeps
    <br>into the hole through the rock from drying out and actually promotes
    <br>corrosion, so don't seal the hole.
    <br>Does anybody out there have any field data to support one practice or the

<p>Old question -- what's the best way to make a bolt hole invisible?
    <br>I've tried JB Weld (dark grey epoxy) mixed with rock dust on my pet
    <br>rock at home, and the bolt hole still looks like a bolt hole,
    <br>only patched with JB Weld. I've heard white epoxy turns yellow
    <br>with time and is also no good, but that polyester resin (i.e. Bondo
    <br>and other plastic hold technologies) may work better. Or mortar
    <br>mix? I want something that's damm near invisible from up close
    <br>on a couple types of reddish grey rock -- has anyone found it?
    <br>Thanks.

<p>While at city of rocks this summer, I noticed a rather unsafe anchoring
    <br>practice. This consists of a 1/2 inch rawl bolt (actually the bolt diameter is
    <br>3/8 inch) with links of 3/8" chain. This system was outlined in climbing
    <br>magazine a while back. The problem is that 3/8" diameter chain will easily fit
    <br>over the head of a 3/8 inch bolt. The only thing keeping the thing from
    <br>pulling over the head is rather flimsey washer. If you use this system use
    <br>5/16" chain. It's plenty strong and won't physically fit over the head of a
    <br>3/8" bolt (but you won't have to deform much metal to do this). Better yet
    <br>use an actual 1/2" diameter bolt (5/8" inch rawl or 1/2" stud bolt) with
    <br>5/16" chain. This will rip the head off the bolt or break the chain.

<p>The ratings of BD daisy's are as follows (3 sigma ratings):

    <br>Nylon 16 kN (3597 lbf) 3 kN (674 lbf)
    <br>Spectra 19 kN (4271 lbf) 3 kN (674 lbf)</p>

<p>Why don't we recommend a Daisy as your primary anchor? Because your rope
    <br>is safer. Worn Daisy's are significantly weaker. If you clip into more
    <br>than one pocket with your carabiner you could find yourself in space if
    <br>you riped the pocket tacks. Use your rope with a locking biner as the
    <br>primary anchor and use your daisy as a backup and as the adjustability.
    <br>Don't trust a single piece with your life either. Two Daisy's are plenty
    <br>strong. Your rope is still safer.</p>

<p>I'll second Russ' comments. Bolts are too important to mess with unless
    <br>you're SURE you know what's going on inside that hole - being "pretty
    <br>sure" doesn't cut the mustard when your life (and more importantly, that
    <br>of the next guy to clip the thing) is at stake.</p>

<p>If you're going to "fix" a bolt, and IF LOCAL ETHICS AND REGS ALLOW,
    <br>drill out the hole to 3/8" or 1/2" and replace it with a fat new bolt
    <br>and a modern, thick stainless hanger (rock-colored if need be or if
    <br>possible). In particular, the beefy Fixe hangers are nice (and
    <br>reassuring for those of us who sometimes climb on those homemade hangers
    <br>at Shelf rd...)</p>

<p>Additionally, I'd say that if you can't use the same hole safely, it's
    <br>time to consider filling in the existing hole with epoxy, cover the end

<p>Daisy's are weaker than runners because, as the pockets rip out, damage to
    <br>the webbing occurs at the pocket tacks. In static testing the pockets rip
    <br>out until you are in the standard runner configuration. The web breaks at
    <br>the damaged area of one of the pocket tacks.</p>

<p>In factor 2 falls with 185 lbs of steel I have seen some break outright
    <br>without popping all the pockets! I have also seen them hold factor
    <br>2 falls and pop all pockets. Dynamic loading is not the same as the
    <br>slow pull we use for batch testing and rating. Runner materials do not
    <br>stretch like your ropes does. Use your rope for your primary anchor and
    <br>use the daisy as a backup and as the adjustability. I have heard reports
    <br>of daisy's breaking in factor 2 aid falls. The samples I have seen that
    <br>broke in the field were fairly well worn. Daisy's get worn quite quickly
    <br>and their strength degrades accordingly. Use your rope as the primary
    <br>anchor!

<p>&gt; I always thought the issue of running a TR through the cold shuts or lowering
    <br>&gt; on a rope passed through the shuts is the heat caused by the friction. It
    <br>&gt;isn't suppose the heat the metal to the point of failure, but the constant
    <br>&gt;heating and cooling can severely weaken the bolt's placement in the rock.
    <br>&gt;Climbing or Rock and Ice had a piece on this several years ago.
    <br>&gt; I could only make it through about half of these messages, so if this has been
    <br>&gt; covered I beg your pardon - go ahead and flame me,</p>

<p>OK
    <br>Me thinks your memory is failing. Too much aluminum dust? Don't lick your
    <br>hands after rappeling, please.
    <br>I posit:</p>

<p>1. Cold shuts are unreliable because who-the-hell knows what they are made
    <br>of? The route setter could of put in heat treated 4130, which would last
    <br>forever, or they might be something really soft, which cuts really easy. The
    <br>way you figure it out is you look at how fast it wears.</p>

<p>2. Loss of temper from lowering heat? I think you're about an order of
    <br>magnitude off here. Your hot belay device ( same amount of energy, less mass
    <br>) burns your hand but not the rope. The temperature to lose temper is quite
    <br>a bit higher.</p>

<p>3. Freeze/thaw like cycles from the lowering heat ? Again, I think you're
    <br>about an order of magnitude off. I think the holes erode from the many
    <br>loadings. The metal itself probably doesn't since you would be way below the
    <br>fatigue limit, though if poorly placed, some specific mechanism might be
    <br>working itself to failure.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone who actually knows something about metal would return fire.</p>

    <br>&gt;So you are saying that anyone that climbes with a locking biner for a
    <br>&gt;couble of years should see a notch in it from the rope running through
    <br>&gt;it. That's a CROCK of shit. But, I'd really like to see a picture of
    <br>&gt;one if you can show me yours.</p>

<p>Wrong. I have a FEW biners with notches worn into them from rapping.
    <br>Try rapping with wet/muddy/sandy ropes some time and you will see
    <br>notches, not in years, but in hours.</p>

    <br>&gt; &gt; I've never seen nor heard anyone talk about any anchor (be it chain,
    <br>&gt; &gt; shut, rap bolt, lap link, or Fixe anchor) that would wear through after
    <br>&gt; &gt; years of lowering through. I've seen plenty of anchors that were
    <br>&gt; &gt; polished, but it would probably take centuries of this abuse before
    <br>&gt; &gt; ropes would file through that metal. It just doesn't make sense.</p>

    <br>&gt; Gee, and because you've never heard anyone talk about it or seen it, therefore
    <br>&gt; it must be false? Tell you what, if you want to see it so you can talk about
    <br>&gt; it, fly to CA, drive to Owens River Gorge, climb a popular route, and look
    <br>&gt; *real* close at the shuts at the top. I've seen them close to halfway worn
    <br>&gt; through on occasion, thankfully rare. On your way home, stop by Wilson's
    <br>&gt; Eastside Sporting Goods in Bishop and give up a buck or two in the collection
    <br>&gt; for the replacement fund of said shuts.
    <br>&gt; That being said, you probably could find something closer to home ( assuming
    <br>&gt; you aren't from CA ), but I can only talk about what *I've* seen.

<p>On this note, Marty Lewis and Kevin Calder, Owens Gorge caretakers and
    <br>new route guys were just here 5 minutes ago stocking up on tons of big
    <br>fat lower off clips to put in the Gorge. Why? To replace worn out
    <br>shuts that are not only grooved, but if the wind kicks up just might
    <br>fail. Come on Greg, get with reality. The Gorge is especially hard on
    <br>shuts from the volcanic pumice that embeds in the rope sheath and then
    <br>saws at the metal. Sounds good to me.

<p>Just as an info thing...at least as of about a year ago, there
    <br>were still cold shut anchors at the top of some of the the climbs
    <br>at Le Petit Verdon (the Pit) near Flagstaff, AZ. I'm sure they went
    <br>in before they were widely accepted as totally unreliable.</p>

<p>For the newbies: It's bad enough rapping on one of these types of
    <br>anchors, but by no means should you toprope off of one. That's how
    <br>they discovered they were weak in the first place (at the cost of
    <br>a few broken bones/deaths).
