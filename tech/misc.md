**Subject: Here's another option for padding the haulbag**\\
From: Mike\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Date: Sat, 29 May 1999 01:16:11 GMT

I hang my sleeping pad rolled up and clipped under the haulbag
because\\
I hated digging it out at the bivy and cramming it back in the\\
morning.

Lots of folks here at r.c. have had good success with padding
the\\
haulbag with cardboard. I liked it: effective, lightweight and
low\\
volume. I had one problem though: the cardboard fell apart when
it\\
got wet after a thundershower.

I did some searching and have found a good substitute: a material
that\\
signmakers use called "core-a-plast". It is a sheet
of material\\
that's identical to corrugated cardboard, but it's made of plastic.

It's light, tough, and works just as good as cardboard. Waterproof\\
too. Look in the yellow pages under "Signs" and ask
local signmakers\\
if they sell core-a-plast. Shop around. The first quote I got
was\\
$36 for a 3'x5' sheet. A few calls later I found a shop selling
a\\
4'x8' sheet for $9. This was more than enough for my 2 haulbags
(one\\
Metolius halfdome, one Fish Grade V).

Many colors are available. I got bright yellow because it enhances\\
visibility when rummaging through the bag. In a pinch, the\\
core-a-plast seems like it would make a decent emergency substitute
if\\
you dropped your sleeping pad. It would probably give you more\\
crushproof insulation than anything else you'd have on hand to\\
improvise with.

Saw something cool this weekend at the SSCA meeting in the
Needles.\\
E.C. "Eddie" Joe showed me his Tibloc (the gear you
perverts!) used in\\
a way that I thought was pure genius. (and not in the Petzl info
sheet)

Use it for simul-climbing.

Clipped to a bomber piece of pro, set in a "hauling"
position with the rope\\
running thru the biner (I know, this is hard to visualize, but
set it up)\\
the Tibloc can be used as pro for simul-climbing that will prevent
the\\
second from pulling off the leader if he falls. If the second
comes off\\
(make sure you two stay pretty close together to minimize load
on\\
Tibloc) the Tibloc will lock off, preventing the load yanking
the leader\\
down the cliff. When you're climbing, the rope feeds like the
Tibloc isn't \\
even there. Way cool.

**Subject: Bent Camalots-New failure report**\\
  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Date: Mon, 5 Apr 1999 11:06:50 -0600

Along the lines of the recent thread on bent camalots I just
received a\\
broken Camalot I wanted to share with everyone.

This failure was reported to me by Bob Gaines in California.
The\\
following is an extract from his email:

"Bob Gaines\\
VERTICAL ADVENTURES CLIMBING SCHOOL

A guy by the name of Ian Katz took about a ten foot fall and
broke a\\
camalot jr. last week at JTree. I saw the piece myself. It broke
at the\\
part where the cable connects at the axel (on the top of the cams..
it\\
sheared in half). Katz placed the piece in a vertical crack with
it\\
sticking straight out horizontally. Any thoughts on this?"

I emailed him back and requested that he send me the broken
unit. Bob\\
wrote back with:

"Thanks for the quick reply. One of my Guides (Dave Mayville)
has the\\
BROKEN CAMALOT JR. in his possesion. It was given to him by Ian
Katz (the\\
guy who owned it and fell on it). Ian is a very experienced 5.11/12
trad\\
climber. He told Dave Mayville that he knew the directionality
of the\\
placement was bad, but it was the best he could get. I'll track
down Ian\\
Katz's phone number so you can call him if you want. In the meantime,
I'll\\
mail you the piece."

I reviewed the Camalot and talked to Ian this morning on the
phone. He\\
found the unit on top of a rock in Jtree. As far as he knew it
had not\\
been dropped and looked ok. My initial assessment of the unit
was that it\\
had been dropped prior to the fall because I saw significant deep\\
scratching of the crossbar intersecting the failure surface and
the side\\
plate on this half of the unit was bent in (the part that failed
is the\\
the one with two holes in it for the axels and is brazed to the
cable-it\\
broke across the two axel holes). I could see evidence of recent
and old\\
scratches due to the level of corrosion in these scratches. Ian
was\\
climbing the route called "Safety Pin--11c" located
on Split Rock. The\\
placement was a shallow one and Ian knew that he could not place
it in the\\
desired direction. He placed it because it was all he could get
in and\\
knew that if he fell he would most likely bend the cables and
make it\\
unusable in the future. He was about 50 feet up and the piece
was at his\\
feet. He fell. The crossbar broke in half and then hooked itself
on the\\
sling, stopping his fall (yes, the Camalot still held his fall
even though\\
it broke). The cables were bent in the direction of the fall but
not\\
severely.

It is my opinion that this unit broke due to the scratches
that were on\\
the crossbar. They were located in a position to act as tension
stress \\
concentration points. Ian thought that the unit did not have these
on it\\
before hand but was not sure. I think that several of these deep\\
sctratches were there before hand. I did not see any other evidence
of\\
defects that would lead to this type of failure. Nor do I think
this\\
sample broke due to tension overload because the cables were not
bent\\
nearly as much as units I have seen previously that have been
fallen on in\\
similar placements (that did not break).

Conclusions: Placements not in the direction of loading are
weaker and we\\
warn people of this in our literaturem, as do others. Finding
gear can be\\
a risky thing. My general rule is that if there is obvious visual
damage\\
(i.e. deep scratches or cracks) then the unit should be discarded.
If\\
there is no obvious visual damage then I would use the unit. I
would most\\
likely have used the unit that Ian had found if I had been the
one to find\\
it as well. The scratches would not have been that easy to see
without\\
close inspection by retracting the cams fully. The same issues
apply to\\
gear you already own and know the history of. This is why you
must\\
regularly inspect your equipment and retire it if there are any
obvious\\
problems. In the case of the original thread on this topic, seeing
a cam\\
with bent cross bars warrants retirement because you never know
what could\\
happen. Chances are good that it could be usable again. But this
is a\\
big if and one which I can't recommend to anyone.

Hope this helps. chris

&gt;&gt; Chris, why does the industry produce climbing equipment

castings? I'm\\
&gt;&gt; sure the increased cost would scare to hell out of the
rec.climbing\\
&gt;&gt; community.\\
\\
&gt;It's not that simple. And it's not a matter of costs. Really.\\
&gt;The way we design and build things at BD is very pragmatic.
We build stuff,\\
&gt;we break it. We think of lots of ways to break stuff, then
we do. There is a\\
&gt;wide selection of processes out there for making different
parts. We look at\\
&gt;and try quite a few, subject them to intense scrutiny and
make a very careful\\
&gt;choice. We are always aware that if we make a bad choice,
the company could\\
&gt;belong to someone else, tomorrow. Chris is the man.

We use castings because they allow us to design components
with complex\\
geometry and function. Generally casting is cheaper but not always.
We\\
have been using castings for many years and have learned a great
deal\\
about the problems and issues that must be delt with in order
to feel\\
confident in the parts. As Tom points out we test a tremendous
amount\\
during prototype and production to ensure that nothing will go
wrong. We\\
do not always succeed with this (note some previous history on
Black\\
Prophet head castings in 1992) but we do very well in my assessment.

\\
&gt;So why do we use castings? On occasion, they are the best
choice. The Powder\\
&gt;Metallurgy pieces on the Cam Jr's are not really a casting,
they are more a\\
&gt;sintering process, but they do suffer a little from being
somewhat brittle.\\
&gt;They do not suffer from voids as cheap castings do. We have
hundreds of\\
&gt;thousands of parts in field with very, very few failures (
this side-loaded\\
&gt;failure is the first I have heard of, though Chris may know
of others ). We\\
&gt;also break several hundred of that particular part a year
in the QA process,\\
&gt;so we have a very good pragmatic understanding of how these
things break.\\
\\
Even expensive castings have shrink voids. We have to design parts
to\\
minimize the impact of this fact. All the single stem camalots
use a cast\\
tailpiece and the #1 uses a cast crossbar. I have never seen a
failure of\\
a cast camalot part. I have seen one other failed Camalot Jr.
0.75 that\\
appears to have failed from a similar bottoming placement not
in the\\
direction of the fall. It broke at the cable and had major damage
and\\
abuse from being removed after being stuck for some time (it is
mangled\\
from hitting with a nut tool and severely corroded). The surfaces
of the\\
cable ends are smashed from handling and there is no evidence
of any\\
defect that I could see with an optical microscope.

&gt;The other castings we use are the stainless steel investment
cast heads of the\\
&gt;ice tools. We have some problems with them not meeting dimensional
specs from\\
&gt;time to time, but otherwise we see few problems with these
parts.\\
&gt;\\
&gt;We have used forged parts from time to time, but, quite frankly,
they're very\\
&gt;overrated. We make Figure 8s and ATC's with them. These obviously
do not get\\
&gt;stressed really high, but we do some thorough testing of them
as if they do.\\
&gt;We have to inspect them pretty carefully. Sometimes when the
dies are not\\
&gt;quite right, the metal does not flow correctly and you end
up with surface\\
&gt;flaws and flow flaws. These are rejected. We also make hot
forged biners\\
&gt;which don't suffer from the same problems because the metal
doesn't get\\
&gt;pushed around as much. But forging is not a very precise process,
and these\\
&gt;things require a lot of hand work to clean up the forgings,
and thus they\\
&gt;become real expensive.\\
&gt;\\
&gt;Biners are made by bending and cold forging ( hitting it with
dies ), then\\
&gt;heat treating. Since Biner's are a bending problem, this is
the best process\\
&gt;for making them.\\
&gt;As far as "micro cracking" and "hidden flaws
in dropped gear", as far as I\\
&gt;know its a myth. Official company line is "use your own
judgement", and I\\
&gt;can't really tell you that the biner you dropped off ElCap
is fine. But I can\\
&gt;tell you that those ones Todd and Paul dropped off the Salathe
broke at full\\
&gt;strength. We generally use ductile materials that don't "micro-crack",
rather\\
&gt;than high tech ceramics that might have this problem.\\
\\
Only the ones that were not visually damaged were full strength.
Those\\
that were visually damaged broke lower.

&gt;I hope this answers your question. Let me assure you that
I am an unlikely\\
&gt;person to be spewing the company line, but as far as our thoroughness
of\\
&gt;engineering I am very happy to spew.\\

A Newton is a unit of force. Kilo means a thousand of them.
Force is\\
how hard the rope pulls on you and your gear as it stops you.
You\\
can't really talk about the "force of a fall" because
the force exerted\\
on the various components of your system varies -- the force on
the\\
faller's harness, the force on the protection, the force on the
\\
belay device, and the force the belayer's hand holds are all different.

Anyway, 1 kilonewton = 225 pounds

One than that may be confusing you is that in physics, you
have to\\
distinguish between mass (an amount of stuff) and weight (the
force \\
that gravity exerts on a given amount of stuff). For non-nerd
climbers,\\
the distinction isn't too important, unless you start climbing
on other\\
planets, where the acceleration due to gravity is different than
on\\
the earth.

Also confusing is that pounds get used for both mass and force,
and \\
there are even various kind of pounds (apothecary, avadapous,
troy). \\
This is one reason (among many others) that science and engineering
\\
people prefer the metric system, hence the prevalent use of kN
rather \\
than pounds.

&gt;If I fall "X" distance and have a "X"
weight, I will cause "X" amount of\\
&gt;Kilo-Newtons on my climbing system.

That's not how it works. X distance and X mass tells you how
much\\
energy your system has to absorb to stop you. The force will depend\\
on how fast you get stopped. For the same distance and mass, the
peak\\
force will be lower if your fall is stopped by a bungee than if
it's\\
stopped by a steel cable, which is why climbing ropes are designed
to \\
stretch.

Bob Harrington did a good job of answering this. Everyone else
seems\\
to misunderstand fall forces to varying degrees.

&gt; If I fall "X" distance and have a "X"
weight, I will cause "X" amount of\\
&gt; Kilo-Newtons on my climbing system.

Heavier climbers will generate proportionally greater forces
in falls,\\
but there is no direct correlation between the distance you fall
and\\
forces. You need to consider the springiness of the rope and a\\
concept called "fall factor", which is ratio of the
distance fallen to\\
the length of rope that absorbs the fall (somewhere between 0
and 2\\
for climbing).

[Aside: It is better to use "effective fall force"
which depends on\\
the distance fallen and the layout of the entire rope including
the\\
friction along its length.]

Note that the force the climber feels will be different from
the force\\
exerted on the gear and at the belay.

For physics nerds, ropes act a lot like springs (during a single\\
stretching phase only). The fall force can be expressed as follows:

F = W (1 + sqrt(1 + 2*eff*M/W)),

where F is the tension in the rope at the bottom of the fall,\\
W is the falling climber's weight\\
eff is the effective fall force, and\\
M is the rope's spring constant.

Deriving this is straightforward, but is just as well left
as an\\
exercise to the reader.

You can see some interesting properties of falls from examining
this\\
formula: Even very low fall factor falls result in a force that
is\\
twice the climber's weight; Also, force doesn't increase linearly
with\\
fall factor - a fall factor 2 fall is about 1.4 times as hard
as a\\
fall factor 1 fall.

&gt; Not having a doctorate in Physics, and wanting to be a
safe climber, I\\
&gt; figured I should understand this.

Most gear is designed to not break in the hardest possible
falls\\
encountered in climbing, and ropes are engineered to keep the
forces\\
in those falls low enough to not break you. Use recommended gear
in\\
recommended ways, back things up when you are unsure, and liberally\\
apply common sense.

&gt;Cowardly? A whiner?

Now this is where I dissagree. It is very possible to break
biners (good\\
ones) well below their rating. Ratings are generated by testing
between\\
two 12 mm steel pins seated against the spine of the biner. The
closer\\
the loading is to the nose of the biner (closer to the gate) then
the\\
weaker it will be and it can easily fail below the rating. Loading
a\\
biner with its nose hook on a bolt hanger can break it under body
weight\\
even though it has an open gate rating of 7 kN. In closed gate,
biners\\
break below their ratings when tested with slings because the
sling\\
applies more load to the nose than to the spine (in comparison
to steel\\
pins). 1" slings will cause biners to break weaker than 1/2"
slings\\
(assuming the biner breaks first--which usually happens by the
way). Much\\
of this type of information is also supplied with carabiner instruction\\
tags.

In this situation we are talking about we do not yet know if
the failure\\
was open gate or closed gate. It is easy to tell by the deformation\\
associated with the parts. If the nose was bent in toward the
spine then\\
it was closed gate, if the nose was bent out then it was open
gate.\\
Assuming the biner failed in open gate then it is very possible
that this\\
carabiner broke because the load was too high for the specific
loading\\
geometry not because there was a defect. The fall you are talking
about\\
is not a totally soft fall. Repeated falls on the same rope, only
30\\
feet of rope, belayer yanking in slack and locking off the belay\\
(assumption on my part because this is what most belayers do when
they\\
are faced with repeated scary falls), etc. can all result in high
force\\
falls even though the fall factor was low. What if the biner had
been\\
shifted and loaded in minor axis? It is not uncommon for biners
to break\\
below their rating and even the example of the biner breaking
at 2 kN when\\
rated at 10 is not impossible (with or without a defect).

If the biner failed in closed gate then I would have a very
hard time\\
believing that the force exceded 15 to 25 kN even in this situation
as\\
described. To fail in closed gate I believe there would have to
be a\\
defect involved in the biner (or minor axis loading could have\\
contributed to it). Hard to say without seeing it myself.

What happened to the biner after it broke? How much time was
there\\
between the fall and the analysis now going on? Was there any
chance that\\
part of the fracture surface came into contact with water? How
have the\\
surfaces been protected from contact with anything? \\
\\
&gt;This piece of pro was placed in textbook-ideal conditions
(welded cold-shut\\
&gt;and all). It failed on a low-factor fall with more than 30
feet of rope out.\\

**Biner Unclipping\\
</font></b>From - Sat Mar 20 00:28:36 1999\\
  From: ratagonia@xxxxxxxxxxx\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Subject: Re: Runners and quick draws

This seemed like a good time to re-post Chris' post about unclipping
testing.\\
Here you go ( this is mostly in reference to Hotwires, and applies
somewhat to\\
all biners, especially wiregates ):

Richard brings up a good point worthy of my response. When
BD designs\\
a carabiner we are concerned with the potential for it to unclip.
In the\\
situation Richard described it is quite easy to cause a carabiner
to\\
unclip and it seems that it is more likely for a Hotwire than
other\\
biners. Due to the potential for unclipping we conduct some fairly\\
involved tests using bolt hangers, Stopper loops, and ice screw
hangers.\\
The test involves a biner secured to a 8" loop quickdraw
(if it is not\\
secured with a Petzel String or rubber band the biners would not\\
unclip--therefore, do not secure your top biner). The test biner
is\\
clipped to the hanger and a person tries to force the biner to
unclip in\\
the manner described by Richard (flipping the draw with your hand
and\\
rotating it at the same time to cause the gate to force itself
on the top\\
of the bolt hanger--note, your hand is not on the quickdraw but
on\\
a biner attached to the free end of the draw). To cause biners
to\\
unclip in this manner requires that you develop the right technique.\\
After playing with this setup I could cause any biner to unclip
once I\\
developed the correct technique for each style. To help randomize
this\\
somewhat we took ten people with five different styles of BD biners.
Each\\
person attempted to unclip each style of biner 10 times (with
a couple of\\
practice tries to develop their own technique). We counted the
number of\\
times the biner was sucessfully unclipped. We found that the Hotwire
was\\
in the middle of the group. The Light D was the easiest to unclip.
The\\
Big Easy was the most difficult. Some people could develop the
technique\\
quickly and others could not. The average number of unclippings
ranged\\
from 3 to 7 out of ten. This indicates that it is relatively easy
to\\
cause any biner to unclip in this very specific situation which
is very\\
difficult to do when actually climbing (although not impossible
and people\\
need to be aware of this). We also conducted this test on competitor's\\
biners for comparison. I don't think it appropriate for me to
comment on\\
their performance other than to say that most all biners perform
the same\\
as ours.

We also found that biners were easier to unclip if the gate
was facing the\\
head of the bolt that secured the hanger to the rock. Due to this
I\\
rotate my top biner with the gate down and out if the orientation
of the\\
lower biner warrants the top biner's gate to be facing the bolt
head.\\
I hope this makes sense. You also have to be aware of rock interference\\
potential which could be far more of a problem in open gate loading\\
situations.

Over the last few years I have heard of a couple of incidents
of\\
unclippings of Hotwires and other styles. From these reports there
is no\\
trend that the Hotwire is any easier to unclip than any other
style. But\\
this is not proof either. Unclipping of biners occurrs about as
often as\\
biners break. i.e. I have heard of about 12 in 5 years. I am sure
I\\
have not heard of all of them though.

**Book review: Advanced Rock Climbing**

From - Tue Feb 9 11:37:35 1999\\
  From: bobh@xxxxxxxxxxxxx(Bob Harrington)\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
\\
Book Review: Advanced Rock Climbing, John Long and Craig\\
Luebben, Chockstone Press.

This book was recommended on r.c several weeks ago. Here's\\
a review of it.

Climbing instruction books are usually aimed at novice\\
climbers, probably because the typical climber reads a book\\
or two when learning how to climb, but once past the novice\\
phase, books are replaced by campfire discussions and harsh\\
experience as the primary source of technical information.\\
In fact, the general tone of the book recalls a campfire\\
give and take, with the easy humor, climberly adjectives,\\
and anecdotal style familiar from Long's other writings\\
evident here.

But Advanced Rock Climbing breaks from the normal pattern by\\
aiming at experienced climbers, and for the most part basic\\
topics are presumed familiar to the reader. Not that beginners\\
would not find this book useful -- they would, as long as\\
they realize that they should look elsewhere for answers to\\
elementary questions.

Deciding what material to include in this book must have\\
posed a problem for the authors -- one person's advanced\\
topic is another's elementary material. The emphasis is\\
on free climbing of all flavors, with sport climbing,\\
crack climbing, cragging and long routes being treated\\
with equal attention. Aid climbing is only given a cursory\\
glance, and snow and ice are beyond the scope.

Free climbing techniques are covered in chapters on face\\
climbing, crack climbing, sport climbing, and training.\\
These chapters are succinct and enjoyable reading.

Things are a get a bit rougher in the chapters detailing\\
anchors and self rescue. Here, rope procedures would\\
have been much clearer if they had been depicted with\\
line drawings rather than the postage stamp size photos\\
that were used. It's hard to tell what's going on in\\
the photos, and the lack of clarity is exacerbated by\\
burying the material describing the procedure in the\\
text, rather than placing it in captions next to the photos.\\
Action shots take up much space in this book -- they're not\\
bad, but I can't help but feel that the space would have\\
been better devoted to improving the how-to-do photo\\
sequences. The illustrations in, say, Andy Selter's\\
cravasse rescue book are far superior renditions of \\
complicated rope maneuvers than the photos in Advanced \\
Rock Climbing.

For the most part, the safety advice wisely left practical,\\
focusing on the likely causes of accidents, rather than \\
delving into hypothetical physics-based discussions.\\
However, one passage seemed particularly weak: on page 90,\\
a table and illustration carefully detail the down side of\\
the 'American triangle' anchor system, that being that it\\
puts an unnecessarily large force on the anchors. This is\\
accompanied by the statement that the forces on the anchor\\
multiply 'exponentially' when the angle of the anchor sling\\
exceeds ninety degrees, a statement that would certainly\\
draw some withering flames were it posted to rec.climbing.

That's a minor enough mistake in wording, but then, fifteen\\
pages later, two anchors are compared -- an American Triangle\\
(rightly criticized) and a setup where two bolts each have\\
a welded ring directly through the hangers, and the rappel\\
rope runs through each ring, forming a ninety degree angle\\
at each ring. This second setup is judged 'GOOD'.\\
Physics-wise, this setup has the same problem as the American\\
Triangle with zero-degree sling angle (from the table on\\
page 90). In a more practical sense, I hate this anchor\\
setup because it generates more friction during retrieval\\
than systems where the rope pulls through a single point.

They also seem to share rec.climbing's phobia regarding\\
bowlines. Page 101 shows exotic means of tieing into the\\
middle of a rope using a figure eight loop, a maneuver that\\
can be accomplished simply and quickly with a bowline.\\
Whatever. Rec.climbing has cured me of arguing the merits\\
of bowlines. Not that the chapters involving equipment and\\
rope maneuvers don't contain a wealth of information,\\
they do, and I learned a lot -- it just could have been\\
presented much more clearly and a bit more thoughtfully.

All in all, a good book, a lot like spending a lengthy\\
session around the campfire picking the brains of a\\
couple of world class experts. I can't imagine\\
that any reader would not learn something from it.\\
The enjoyable and informative text make it worthwhile, but\\
the muddy graphical presentation will probably prevent it\\
from achieving classic status.

Here's how I understand it......present day ratings for routes
done in the last 10 years.

A0 - Full on bomber and easy to find. Fall potential no more
than 20-30 feet. Ex: Nose, Salathe, Leaning Tower, South Face
of the\\
Column. etc.

A1 - Easy to find and easy to place. A basic no brainer, but
if you do many dumb things in a row, you will go up to 40 feet.
Ex:\\
Lurking Fear (A1+), Prow, Muir (A1+)

A2 - Here is where it starts. Placements could be hard to find
and or awkward to place. Fall potential of up to 60 feet or more.
Ex:\\
Shield, Mescalito (A2+), Aquarian, Tangerine Trip, Horse Chute
(A2+)

A3 - Big whippers hiding out here. Many tricks are used and
everything is suspect. Rock is usually loose and bad landings
may\\
appear. Fall potential of up to 100 feet, and possible dismemberment,
but not death due to hitting things. Ex: NA Wall (A3-) Iron\\
Hawk (A3+), P.O. Wall, Zenyatta (A3+)

A4 - Bombs away. All known tricks are used including exhaling
to make yourself lighter. This is where lids pop off and sane
humans\\
never venture. Fall potential: 150-200 feet with a bad landing
almost assured. Wear a helmet for the open casket hoe-down. Ex:\\
Native Son. GulfStream (A4+), Born Under a Bad Sign, Surgeon General,
South Seas (A4-), Space.

A5 - Lights out. Count on multi-hour leads with about 6-10
being the norm. Nobody falls here because you only get one. No
rookies\\
allowed. Every piece is shitty, all the rock is bad, and you always
hit things. Fall potential: Pull the pitch. Ex: Scorched Earth?,\\
Sheep Ranch (A5-), Get Whacked, Plastic Surgery Disaster.

Of course all of the above are subjective blah blah...... Most
of the examples are either confirmed by someone here at FP or
by the FA\\
party. This is real and scary. Enjoy!\\

**A comment on the rating system**

by Eric Coomer July 8, 1998:

"Huh. So you say it takes like 70 heads?"

"Yeah. And 30 blades and 20 beaks and 8 rurps. A bunch
of arrows and some angles thrown in. There's no pitch you're going
to go\\
more than about 120 to 150 feet if you blow it."

"Uh, A3+ huh?"

"Yeah." The sly smile of the devil crossed Warren
Hollinger's face. Today, A3+ is a whole lot like the 5.9+ grade
of the golden age of free climbing. It could mean anything. I've
done A3+ pitches that involved nothing more than leap frogging
good cams up a perfect splitter crack. Other pitches have been
full on nailing fests with copious hooking and many insecure placements.
It seems like most new routes and downgraded old test pieces fall
somewhere in the A3+ to A4 range. Meanwhile, old outdated trade
routes still sport A4 and A5 pitches on the topos. What's an aspiring
wanna-be to do?

Warren also confided that he thought his new route was the
second hardest route he's ever done on El Capitan. That's quite
a statement. It appears that the Reticent is the only wall to
receive a modern A5 grade that has stuck. Even so, a recent ascent
party argued that it was already A4+.

The aid ratings have gotten out of hand. It's the opposite
problem with the open ended free ratings. Everyone at the top
end of the free scale wants the first 5.15. In contrast, no wall
climber wants to rate his pitch A5 only to have others laugh and
call it a light A2+. The grades have become compressed and it
lies right around A3+. Maybe it's time to rethink this whole problem.
Maybe it's time to give the Casual Rating System (CRS) another
shot at life.

After doing the second ascent of Warren's new route, we (myself
and my partners Eric George and Brent "Call me Eric"
Ware) all agreed that the route was Pretty Darn Hard (PDH in CRS
terms). Warren asked us what we thought and we told him straight.
Lots of\\
good hard climbing but some good gear on the pitch somewhere.
No real death fall potential except in a couple of spots- maybe
some of the pitches need a Real Heads Up (RHU) modifier. Another
member of the first ascent team, Miles Smart, had one of the two
crux\\
pitches. He confided that during the route the sandbagging got
a little out of hand. He wanted to call his pitch A2+. They all
realized that this was a ridiculous claim. The pitch has one of
the only real bad falls on the route, tenuous beaking, and a high
fear factor. That's when they decided to call the route A3+. They
really wanted to rate it PDD - Pretty Darn Disorderly.

Endless arguments abound in the Center of the Universe parking lot (the Lodge 
  Lot in Yosemite) about whether the latest route of interest is indeed A4-, maybe 
  A3++, but no one argues whether the routes are hard. They are, and we all know 
  it. Most of the old trade routes probably fall in to the Not Too Bad (NTB) category 
  these days, but a few still sport RHU pitches. By going to this sort of scale 
  no one really has to wonder whether we're talking new wave or old wave. NTB 
  is just that - Not Too Bad. RHU? You better watch your fall or you might end 
  up pretty messy if you fall. PDH. That'll keep you on your toes pretty good. 
  PDD - be prepared for some good fun.
