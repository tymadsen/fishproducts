**Subject: Re: knots for two-rope rappells**\\

Charles Danforth &lt;danforth@xxxxxxxxxxxx&gt; writes

&gt; OK, I'm in need of some wisdom here (yeah, I know this
may not be the best\\
&gt; place to look). We just returned from Seneca and have been
arguing about\\
&gt; the best knot to use for a long two-rope double roped rap.
Steve argues\\
&gt; for the traditional double fisherman's knot with backups.
I maintain that\\
&gt; a two-rope figure eight (i.e. lay the ropes with the ends
facing the same\\
&gt; direction and just tie an 8) has advantages when it comes
to pulling it\\
&gt; down and extricating it from cracks. Sure it looks a bit
wierd. \\
&gt; Any opinions?\\
&gt; Charles

This is a frequent topic here and someone will probably disagree
with\\
me - ignore them they don't know what they are spewing.

You are right, though you can do better. Use an overhand (with
tails\\
coming out the same side of the knot) since it is simpler and
better\\
than an eight in for this purpose. Always leave enough tail to
allow\\
the knot to invert, though this won't happen if you tighten it\\
properly in the first place. Leaving too much tail is a mistake
- you\\
don't want to mistake the tails for the working ropes. Check the
knot\\
before each rappel during multi-pitch descents.

Although the overhand (also figure eight) knot can invert,
it is\\
plenty strong for rappelling. It is also safer because, as you\\
mentioned, it is less likely to get hung up during retrieval.

Ken

(NOTE: The fig. 8 knot described here (lay ends parallel
etc) seems to have caused at least one death due to the knot slipping
and coming undone. Some have said this can happen at loads as
low as 50Kg..... that is 110lbs for the metrically challenged.)

Newsgroups: rec.climbing

  mdimeo@xxxxxxxxxxxx writes:\\
  &gt; In article &lt;u7ls0i9cq.fsf@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;,\\
&gt; &gt; As if TR on static rope results in forces on the same
order as lead\\
&gt; &gt; falls. You'd have to seriously screw up for that to
happen. \\
&gt; They say (but you know the kind of things that "they"
say) that\\
&gt; forces of 1000 lbf have been measured at toprope anchors
with\\
&gt; dynamic rope (whether the belayer "screwed up",
seriously or\\
&gt; otherwise, I don't know). That's around 4.5kN. What's your
guess as\\
&gt; to how much static rope would increase that? Double? 9kN
is where\\
&gt; crossloaded or open-gate biners can be expected to break.
And I'd\\
&gt; bet double is way too optimistic. If it's as much as quadruple,\\
&gt; girth hitched slings could break where biner-linked slings
might\\
&gt; not.

The short answer is that fall force is not linear with free-fall\\
distance or rope characteristics, and top roping on static rope
won't\\
result in equipment failure and death. A 200 pound slingshot top\\
roper will load the anchor with about 660 pounds of force in a
fall\\
with zero slack, regardless of whether the rope is dynamic, static,\\
bungee, or steel cable. As you add free-fall, the force felt by
the\\
anchor starts to depend on the type of rope, but the transition
isn't\\
all that abrupt for the types of rope that climbers use.

In testing, static ropes appear to be about 3 times as stiff
as\\
dynamic ropes at body weight loads: the modulus of elasticity
for\\
static ropes at bodyweight loads is around 16000-20000 lbf/ft/ft,\\
while dynamic ropes check in around 4000-8000 [Stephen W. Attaway,\\
Rope System Analysis]. You might expect worst case forces to be
3\\
times as high for static rope, but testing on Blue Water ropes
[CWIG\\
Standards Development Basic Research Summary, 1993] shows only
a\\
factor of 2 for HARD falls. Note that for mild falls, like those\\
encountered in top-roping, will not result in as large a factor
of\\
difference between static and dynamic ropes.

For example, the 1000 lbf anchor force fall you mentioned is
easily\\
generated on dynamic rope under the following conditions: 30 foot
rope\\
with static belay, 200 lb climber, and 1.5 feet of slack. With
static\\
rope, these same conditions will result in a force of about 1500\\
pounds. Note that most belay devices will begin to slip under
these\\
conditions, reducing the actual force on the anchor. Now increase
the\\
slack to 6 feet and what do you expect? If you think this body-length\\
fall on a short static rope will generate dangerously high forces,
you\\
are mistaken. In fact, these severe static rope TR conditions
will\\
result in only 1/3 or so more force, about 2000 pounds total on
the\\
anchor. Even a girth hitch tied in Karl's old supertape would
hold\\
this.

These numbers assume that ropes behave like springs (an assumption\\
supported by the literature and verified by my own analysis of
fall\\
force data), a 200 lb climber, static rope with modulus of elasticity\\
of 18000 lbf/ft/ft, and a force ratio of 1:0.6 over the carabiner.\\
The normal laws of physics apply.

Any questions?

**Subject: Figure 9 Rappel &amp; Tie-In Knot Test**\\
  From: ratagonia@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Date: Fri, 07 May 1999 00:06:53 GMT

Someone out there proposed the Figure 9 knot as a superior
Rappel Knot. The\\
loading situation is the same as using your rope tie-in loop as
a belay loop.\\
A figure 9 knot is like a figure 8, but you go a half-turn further
before\\
finishing it.

BD Test Doc # TD 15025 4-28-99 Tom Jones

Load Speed 8"/minute. 10mm steel pins top and bottom.

Test was performed using a slightly used 10.5mm Yellow rope.
A figure 9 knot\\
was tied forming a short loop. Two pins were inserted into the
loop and\\
pulled apart. Performance was compared to a Figure 8 knot tested
under the\\
same conditions.

Fig 9 Results: The rope stretched and the knot tightened as
usual. Unlike a\\
fig 8 knot, the fig 9 does not creep down the free ends - the
knot\\
essentially has a built in backup knot. Under loading, the knot
"looks like"\\
two knots - a front knot and a back knot. At about 2900 lbs, the
front knot\\
inverts over the back knot, and the load drops to about 2700 lbs.
Loading\\
continues and the load increases fairly smoothly up to 4000 lbs,
where the\\
sheath breaks on one side. Max load achieved was 4398 lbs. Neglible
creep at\\
the free ends was experienced.

Fig 8 (with backup knot ) Results: loads up and stretches.
At 1500 lbs, the\\
knot inverts, and the load drops to about 1000 lbs. Reloads slowly,
but it\\
creeps along the free ends at a load of about 1000 lbs until it
hits the\\
backup knot. Then it loads fairly evenly to 4509 lbs where one
side of the\\
sheath breaks. Max load was 4509 lbs.

My Conclusions:\\
A. Figure 8 knot should be used with a backup knot.\\
B. Figure 9 knot is essentially a backed up figure 8.\\
C. Maybe I'll use a fig 9 next time.

**Subject: My Dan Osman Rope Failure Analysis**\\
  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Date: Fri, 16 Jul 1999 12:09:11 -0600

I think it is time I spoke up publicly. I have reviewed Dano's
rope in\\
some detail. My findings and theory support those published by
Kevin\\
Worrall in Climbing (No 183, March 1999, Pg 90).

**This statement is mine personally and NOT that of Black
Diamond Equipment!**\\
This is obvious as you read below.

Irrelevant Background: \\
I am a Materials Engineer with BS degrees in Physics and Materials\\
Engineering and a ME in Materials Engineering (I nearly finished
a PhD but\\
bailed once I learned I did not enjoy being a scientist any longer).
I\\
know lots about atomic layer semiconductor crystal growth. I have
been\\
the Quality Assurance Manager for Black Diamond Equipment for
6 years. My\\
primary responsibility is the testing and analysis of climbing
equipment,\\
among other stuff. I have been involved in the ASTM climbing and\\
mountaineering standards development for the last 4 years. I investigate\\
all accidents I hear of involving equipment failure, whether they
are BD's\\
or not. I review rec.climbing every day looking specifically for
posts\\
related to accidents, gear, misuses of gear, issues about BD,
etc. I, and\\
others at BD, go out of our way on this news group to publish
information\\
above and beyond what is required by the standards that climbing
gear is\\
designed to (see the recent lame thread on "Gear Safety"
which I will not\\
respond to specifically. See Karl Lew's web site. Search under
my name\\
on dejanews for examples). I do not post to this news group as
a general\\
rule unless I think that posts from various people are specifically
wrong\\
or misleading, as is the current case (in fact I try to avoid
posting\\
because of commercial conflict of interest). I respond to individuals
on\\
this news group constantly and my comments to these people come
back into\\
this group (see the current RP thread on soldering cable fatigue).
I\\
respond in detail to individuals who ask me questions, even when
they do\\
not like what BD is about (see recent Camalot threads and failure
analysis\\
associated with this thread).

Even more irrelevant background:\\
I have been rock climbing since 1981, and am primarily a trad
climber. I\\
am a risk taker because I climb. Climbing IS dangerous and anyone
who\\
thinks otherwise if fooling themselves. Anyone who climbs is a
risk taker\\
in my opinion. I climb 5.12 on any rock type (that I have been
on) and\\
style (except offwidth, so far) and have onsighted up to 12c/d.
I climb\\
WI6 and possibly harder (ice is either hard or easy to me and
is my\\
primary passion). I climb M8. I establish new rock, ice and mixed\\
routes ground up with and without bolts. I have no aid or alpine\\
experience. I weight 190 lbs and take upside-down 40 to 60 footers\\
without my helmet on. I have nearly killed myself several times
due to\\
falling off 5.8. I am a climber, climbing eventually involves
falling,\\
which may very well kill or maim me. Most people, including myself,
would\\
consider me to be reckless because of how I climb. I climb for
my own\\
reasons and no one else's. I don't care what people think about
me in\\
general. Why Dano jumped off cliffs is his own personal choice
that\\
nobody has a right to argue against, even if he had children in
my\\
opinion. I certainly have no right to judge his reasons for doing
what he\\
did. I respect Dano for pushing the limits way way beyond where
they had\\
been previously. I met Dano twice but did not know him. I know
many of\\
his friends.

Relevant Background:\\
My expertise in the analysis of broken climbing ropes is very
limited.\\
This is due to the fact that climbing ropes very rarely break
or cut in\\
actual use. The only previous experience I have with rope failure\\
analysis was that of Matt Baxter who died on El Cap several years
ago when\\
his rope was cut by a flake after a carabiner had broken (see
dejanews for\\
more info on this, send a Freedom of Information Request to the
NPS-I\\
recommend you do it for the Dano accident as well and then you
can have a\\
copy of my official report, or look at ANAM). I have also reviewed\\
several ropes with sheaths shredded due to the open back regular
carabiner\\
gates in minor axis. This lack of experience could indicate that
my\\
findings are incorrect or suspect.

I first became involved in Dano's accident when news of Dano's
death\\
spread across this news group with the associated rumors that
the NPS\\
might have purposely cut his rope. On December 9, 1998 I sent
an email to\\
John Dill (YOSAR director) letting him know of these rumors on
this news\\
group and offered my assistance in the analysis of Dano's equipment.
John\\
responded back that Yosemite Law Enforcement (YLE) was investigating
the\\
accident and that they had to finish their investigation before
I might be\\
able to see the ropes (they too knew of the rumors of murder and
were\\
investigating this as well I suspect). As you all should know
Dan's ropes\\
stayed on the wall for over a month and YLE was unable to recover
them.\\
Given the rumors of tampering by the NPS a climber took matters
into his\\
own hands. He recovered the ropes and sent them directly to BD.
As soon\\
as I received the ropes I contacted YLE because I was in possession
of\\
stolen federal evidence from an active investigation. I was told
to\\
return the ropes immediately and reveal the name of the person
who sent me\\
the ropes. While on the phone with the lead investigator another
phone\\
call came into BD from "someone within YLE" stating
that the FBI would be\\
at BD to arrest me if I did not send the ropes back the next day.
I was\\
freaking out to say the least. Meanwhile I looked at the rope
in some\\
detail. It was melted through. It looked as if there were the\\
possibility that someone had hot cut the rope. When I called YLE
back and\\
told them this they wanted me to conduct my full investigation
and allowed\\
me to keep the rope for two weeks. No FBI showed up to haul me
away.

Analysis:

I only saw the one section of rope that was cut down and contained
the\\
failure point. I did not see the rigging, retrieval rope, or the
section\\
that was attached to Dan directly.

Everything I did was visual examination. I did not untie any
knot or\\
tamper with the rope in any way other than prying the knots to
see inside.\\
With some insight from Doug Heinrich I concluded that the failure
of Dan's\\
rope was not due to tensile overload or from being tampered with.
I\\
strongly believe that Dan did miscalculate on his last jump. For
some\\
reason he moved his jump site. In doing so he crossed the ropes
(either\\
on the retrieval line or on the main jump line). When he jumped
the first\\
knot above the one he was tied in with slid down a section of
rope several\\
lengths up. The sheath was heavily melted and removed in several
sections\\
on this upper part of the rope. The knot that slid down the rope
was\\
melted in multiple locations and was melted nearly completely
through,\\
deep inside the knot. This knot was not tight, yet others in the
system\\
were (this is the one open question that is unresolved as far
as I know).\\
It is my conclusion that Dan's rope was cut by his own rope sliding\\
against itself. Use of a magnifying glass indicated to me that
the cut\\
surface was due to sliding action in one direction. There was
no evidence\\
of hot cutting with a knife or other type of instrument. I conducted\\
further experiments in my lab to see if tensile overload could
have caused\\
this failure. The samples I tested were significantly different
in that\\
they were heavily frayed and tattered. My analysis of Dan's ropes
in\\
general was that they were in great condition. There was no evidence
to\\
me of damage due to previous falls, uv exposure, or weather. I
would have\\
climbed on these ropes without any hesitation had they not been
from this\\
accident. I do not believe that the condition of the ropes had
anything\\
at all to do with the failure of the ropes. Nor do I believe that
Dan's\\
basic shock absorbing setup was incorrect. Crossing the ropes
was the\\
problem.

I was asked by YLE not to make my findings public until they
had finished\\
their criminal investigation. They forced me to tell them who
sent me the\\
rope and they pressed charges against this individual (I will
have to live\\
with the fact that I was unable to keep this information confidential).
I\\
still have not heard back from YLE about closure of this accident
and\\
decided to make my findings public now due to the vast numbers
of\\
misinformed posts relative to this subject. Maybe my analysis
will stop\\
some of the useless bickering many of you are currently engaged
in.

Conclusions:\\
What is to be learned from this accident? NEVER LET NYLON SLIDE
AGAINST\\
NYLON! You should already know this.

I also know that Dano's rigging setup was reviewed by more
than a couple\\
of technically competent people. I also know that he tested it
multiple\\
times. I personally do not think that what Dan was doing (when
done\\
properly as he had done on earlier jumps) was any more dangerous
than\\
modern ice climbers doing hard thin ice routes (like in Maple
Canyon and\\
elsewhere), in fact his setup was most likely safer in my personal\\
opinion. Dan's death was a tragedy and an accident.

No rope (including "cut-resistant" models) will survive
the fall when\\

It's the arbitrary "cut-off," if you'll excuse the pun,

**Subject: Test Report - Fig 8 Tie In Knot**\\
  From: ratagonia@xxxxxxxxxxxx\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Date: Fri, 22 Jan 1999 23:02:50 GMT

I tested a figure 8 as a tie in knot using the test machine at
Black Diamond.\\
This was to see how strong the 'belay loop' formed by your tie
in knot is.

Rope: slightly used 9.7mm single rope\\
Knot: follow through figure 8 like when tieing in\\
Date: Dec 16, 1998

Setup: pulled at 4"/minute. Pulled as a loop with the
knot in the center of\\
one of the strands. Used 1" pins both ends.

Results: Knot loads steadily and tightens up to 2200 lbf. At
this point, the\\
knot starts to roll, and the force drops to 1500 lbf. Then the
stiff end of\\
the rope where it is taped started to get sucked into the knot,
and the\\
rolling action stops. Load increased steadily to 4050 lbf, where
the sheath\\
on the non-knot side broke. Force drops to 3400 lbf. Load increased
steadily\\
to 4050 lbf, where the sheath on the knot side, upper strand broke.
Force\\
drops to 3750 lbf. Load increased steadily to 4884 lbf, where
the core broke\\
at the knot, breaking the loop.

Conclusions: Figure 8 knot can roll in this loading configuration
( belay\\
loop on harness or when used as quick rappel knot ) at a load
on the order of\\
1500 - 2000 lbs. It will continue to roll until some mechanism
stops it. A\\
backup knot on a figure 8 in a pulled-apart loading configuration
actual does\\
something. I will use these from now on when rappelling. Ultimate
strength of\\
loop is &gt; 16kN belay loop strength.

Additional Comments:\\
One data sample only gives you a general idea of what is going
on. Loads for\\
rolling and for breaking can be expected to vary quite a bit with
rope size,\\
surface conditions and loading sequence. Having one side jammed
up against a\\
chain or rappel ring may also effect this. Take this with a grain
of salt,\\
please.

**Subject: Rope Life--Some Data**\\
  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Date: Tue, 19 Jan 1999 14:00:41 -0700

Here is some test data from an investigation I conducted last
summer.\\
Ropes were provided by a customer who was asking similar questions
as you\\
all are.

All ropes were used slightly. I conducted a pull test on a
loop of rope\\
with an overhand followthrough knot (used this knot to minimize
knot\\
tightening and test machine travel). I did not conduct drop tests
because\\
we do not have this capability at this time.

1) 1986 Chouinard 8.8 mm. 3240 lbf @ knot. (this is a half
rope)\\
2) 1986 Chouinard 11 mm. 5944 lbf @ knot.\\
3) 25 year old 11 mm Edelrid. 5141 lbf @ knot.

Conclusions. Don't know how strong these ropes were when new.
Single\\
strand strength of these ropes is conservatively half the loop
strength\\
(big assumption on my part). I would say this is pretty good overall.
I\\
do not know what the dynamic properties of these ropes were nor
do I know\\
how time affects the dynamic properties. My recommendation to
the\\
customer was to not take any chances with the ropes in lead climbing.
I\\
would use them for top roping without any reservations.

Data from a test I conducted on 12/22/98 (research into Dan
Osman's failed\\
rope--to be published later so don't ask questions about this
right now\\
please). Loop, knot was a quad followthrough figure 8 (I have
a new\\
machine now and can test with longer travel).

All ropes are BD ropes. New condition 1997 ropes.

1) 11 mm. 6643 lbf @ knot.\\
2) 11 mm. 6803 lbf @ knot.\\
3) 10 mm. 4596 lbf @ knot.\\
4) 10 mm. 4765 lbf @ knot.\\
5) 10 mm. 4952 lbf @ knot.

Conclusions: very strong.

My Conclusions and Recommendations. Rope strength does not
appear to\\
decrease with time. I don't trust old ropes because I do not know
how the\\
elastic properties change with time. This needs further research.
Chris.

&gt;point having it if you can't play with it:-). Anyway, one
of the samples\\
&gt;was a really sad old 11mm rope. It was approximately 10 years
old, and\\
&gt;heavily used, both for climbing and for caving. Apparently
it'd also been\\
&gt;used to tow a couple of cars since it's retirement too!!!!
We tied a chunk\\
&gt;into a loop using double fishermans knots, and used 10mm steel
rod for the\\
&gt;load points (to simulate loading on a carabiner). The sample
failed at about\\
&gt;1500kg (3300lbf), which is about what we expected (like I
said, it was a\\
&gt;stuffed rope), but what we didn't expect was that it went
at the load point,\\
&gt;_not_ at the knot. I'm sure we could have got higher figures
and failure at\\
&gt;the knot if we'd used larger diameter stock for the fittings,
but that\\
&gt;seemed a bit silly (since I don't normally used 20mm diam
krabs:-).

&gt;Elongation was impressive - including stretch and knot slippage
the loop was\\
&gt;about 3 times the initial size when it went. The photos of
it near breaking\\
&gt;point are very cool, and enough to convince most skeptics
that even old\\
&gt;ropes are pretty strong!

**cumulative damage on ropes**\\

There is an implicit idea in the falls on a discussion that
I've never\\
been able to figure out. What is the cumulative relationship of
number of\\
fall to rope damage over time. In other words, does a factor 1
fall cause\\
the same amount of damage to a rope when its had few falls on
it as when\\
the rope has had say 15 factor 1 falls on it.

The usual sources seem to suggest an additive or a least linear\\
relationship between rope damage and number of falls of a given
force. My\\
intuition suggests that a curvelinear or exponential relationship
would be\\
more accuate description.\\
George, Clyde, and other rope physics guys, what gives?

Sorry, I failed the same physics class twice in college (hey

when I did the\\
article and nobody had done any serious research (read: takes
a lot of time and\\
money). The tests by Bluewater on "sport falls" (high
repitition, low fall\\
factor) did seem to indicate the rope damage was curvilinear but
they did not do\\
enough tests to be statistically valid.

The tests by the DAV (similar to BW - low fall factor falls)
showed serious\\
rope damage after 80 falls (pretty much anybody would have retired
the rope\\
by that point), however the rope held more than 200 falls before
breaking.

Interesting POV... and you are right. A rope loses its'\\
ability to withstand the force of a fall in somthing other than
a\\
linear manner; however, I am not sure that it can be expressed\\
exponentially, either. After the very FIRST fall (let's use\\
factor 2 as an example, since the UIAA tests are rather close
to\\
that) a rope will lose much of its' elasticity, thereby SUDDENLY\\
losing much of it's capacity for force absorption. After that
one\\
fall, the rope loses less elasticity with each fall (there's less\\
to lose!), and what is happening during the rest of the drops
is\\
that the fibers are taking the damage. This is nearly impossible\\
to quantify, though, since the fibers are ameliorating this\\
damage randomly over a long length of rope.\\
Take this concept to your climbing rope and it gets even\\
less definable, since you (probably) fall on a different length\\
of rope each time with a different fall factor...\\

There is some validity to this but it is minor to other factors.
FWIW\\
all of the rope companies send their dry ropes for the UIAA\\

two extra drops over the standard ropes. This is due to the lubricity
of\\
the dry treatement. The effect is greatly diminshed once the ropes
get\\
dirty.

&gt; With a dynamic rope, the implication is that the section
of\\

and\\
&gt; (barring defects or damage) the rope will always break (if
ever)\\
&gt; on the climber's side of the rope.

This is absolutely true. The difference between the theoretical
fall\\
factor and the effective fall factor is significant but is's mostly
due\\
to friction in the system. It's not practical to calculate however
so\\
nobody does. In the drop test, the rope always breaks at the orifice.

&gt; More interesting, perhaps it is this factor (if it is)
that\\

by\\

Don't think so. Friction is the main culprit not only at the
top biner\\
but all those below it and rope against rock.

&gt; If the rope is in fact pinching itself at the high poin\\
&gt; carabiner, then another implication is that fall factor is\\
&gt; misunderstoodd as it applies to overall effects on rope\\
&gt; damage.

Hell most climber's don't understand fall factors enough to
be able to\\
misunderstand them.

&gt; Also, is there efectively a higher fall factor\\
&gt; experienced by the climber's side of the rope than the belayer's?

True.

The friction over rock and through each carabiner reduces the

Old news but it doesn't seem like a good idea to soak your
rope in gas\\
anyways (what about all the additives?). Acid is the big no-no.

&gt; 2) "An American product (Sharpie) specifically sold
for marking the middle\\

Actually Sharpies are not marketed for marking ropes (can you
say\\
"liability" ;-) and it even says on the pen "not
for cloth." The only\\
pen I know of sold for ropes is Bluewaters and they control the
solvent\\
used.

&gt; 3) "It appears it is not possible to damage ropes
by walking on them with\\
&gt; heavy boots even when the rope lies on sharp edges. Even
walking on the\\

Yep, but I still don't like someone walking on *my* lifeline.

&gt; 4)... "wet or iced ropes experience a major drop
in edge strength (falls\\
&gt; for half rope go from 9 to 3) regardless of whether they
are dry treated\\
&gt; or not."

There is no official edge test so stuff like this has to be
taken with a\\
grain of salt. The bigger question is what happens to impact forces?

&gt; 5) Recent comparison testing of climbing ropes among various
labs\\
&gt; has shown that the results are all over the map (up to 100%)
on a variety\\
&gt; of parameters.

I reported this years ago and Mammut/Edelrid recently showed
how\\
pervasive the problem is. The UIAA never calibrated/cross-checked
the\\
official labs, duh. It basically means the reported stats are
not\\
reliable between brands until the UIAA gets their act together.
Some\\
companies have been accused of manipulating the data for marketing
but\\
there is no way to verify this. Caveat Emptor.

&gt; 6) Ropes used for top roping lose strength over an edge
very quickly. "They\\
&gt; should not be used for field work."

No surprise. Same reason sport climbing is so hard on ropes.

&gt; 7) The official position of the Safety Commission regarding
rope use for\\

rope is perfectly\\

Nice of them to acknowledge what everyone has done for ages.

Taking a break from my deadline. Bah humbug.

&gt;I understand that rope ages but by\\

that they do not\\
&gt; need plasticisers and therefore only age when the long chains
are broken by\\
&gt; chemicals or UV light.

They do use plasticizers in nylon but it depends on the application.\\
Case in point: high-quality sunglass frames (eg. Vuarnet) are
made of\\
"French" nylon which has a much higher plasticizer content
than the\\
cheap drugstore variety (also nylon) that are prone to snapping,\\
especially after a year. This material does leach out with time.\\
Research has shown that UV degradation is less of a factor in
climbing\\
ropes than ozone.

&gt; The following is an excerpt from BlueWater's web page;\\
&gt; "Shelf life Although there is no conclusive evidence
from nylon\\
&gt; manufacturers, we recommend the shelf life of an unused rope
to be five\\
&gt; years."\\
&gt; It maybe that some softeners/plasticisers are used or that
the polymers\\
&gt; breakdone by other means. If I find any further information
I'll post it'\\
&gt; in the mean time does any one else have any thing to add?

The polyamid used in ropes is nylon 6,6 but that is just part
of the\\
recipe, there are additives (UV inhibitors, dyes, etc.) and coatings\\
applied as well. Testing the raw material has little meaning to
a final\\
rope, hence BW' statement. Much of a rope's characteristics are\\
determined by twisting of the core fibers and the all-important
heat\\
set. This cooking of the rope stabilizes the nylon (it shrinks)
but it\\
is hardly permanent.

Here is an interesting summary of one rope that was very heavily
used,\\
abused, retired, and then tested. Don't take this information
to mean\\
that you should not retire your ropes after severe falls or heavy
abuse.

BD gave a 10 mm rope to Merill Bitter. Merill climbs more than
anyone I\\
know. You could say that he is anal about keeping records of his\\
climbing. Merill is one of the best climbers in Utah and has redpointed\\
5.14 and has put up numerous 5.12 trad routes in the area. The
following\\
data is from his climbing log. This rope was manufactured in 1996.\\
Merill weighs about 125 lbs (my guess).

rope used during 71 days of hard sport climhbing-\\
628 Falls (2 to 25 feet)\\
625 Lead Climbs\\
198 Top Ropes\\
1242 Hangs or "takes"\\
636 lowers from anchors\\
2 double line rappels\\
1 Jumar pitch

2 sections of rope were cut off (15 feet from each end) due
to core shots\\
suffered from the above abuse."

I took Merill's rope and had it tested according to the UIAA/CEN
rope\\
standards. Two tests were done. One from the end of the rope and
one\\
from the middle of the rope. I thank BEAL Cordes for this testing.

The UIAA test is a 1.78 fall factor with 178 lbs. This is an
extremely\\
hard fall with static belay!

Sample 1 (end of the rope).\\
Number of falls to cause failure: 1\\
Impact Force 7.45 kN (1674 lbf)

Sample 2 (middle of the rope).\\
Number of falls to cause failure: 3\\
Impact Force on 1st drop 7.41 kN\\
Impact Force on 2nd drop 9.20 kN\\
Impact Force on 3rd drop 10.45 kN.

This demonstrates that the impact force increases rapidly with
repeated\\
falls. It also shows that this rope performed very well considering
the\\
amount of use it has seen. I certainly don't recommend that anyone
use a\\
rope to this extreme. When new these ropes would hold between
7 and 10\\
falls and the impact forces on the first drop were in the 6.5
kN range.\\
It is amazing that the impact forces on this rope are as low as
they are.\\
Note, BD ropes have some of the lowest impact forces on the market
(our\\
ropes are manufactured by Beal and PMI) so don't assume that your
rope\\
will perform the same as this one has. Lower impact force ropes
equate to\\
lower forces on the gear which increases the probability that
the gear\\
will hold the fall. Note, the impact force is that felt by the
"climber"\\
or the tension in the rope. The protection would have felt about
1.6\\
times the force stated. For the third fall above the protection
would\\
have felt about 3700 pounds of force (greater than 16 kN) which
is more\\
than enough to break stoppers, Camalot Jr's, carabiners in open
or closed\\
gate, etc. In real life the forces will be significantly lower
due to\\
energy absorbtion due to belay device slippage (friction), two
bodys\\
involved instead of steel and a static belay. FWIW.

The\\

a new\\

though.\\
&gt; Maybe manufactureres have new recommendations on this subject
- if\\
&gt; so, I'd love to hear them.\\
&gt;\\
&gt; One thing is clear: After holding a fall, a rope's shock-absorbency\\

to\\
&gt; rest. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in\\
&gt; shock-absorbency has contributed to the breaking of carabiners
that\\
&gt; occasionally occurs during falls. Even if the rope doesn't
break\\
&gt; (climbing rope failure is, after all, extraordinarily rare),
an worn\\
&gt; out rope might contribute to an accident.\\
&gt;\\
&gt; There is one thing I do agree with wholeheartedly: Use your\\

failure.\\

you from your belayer.\\
&gt; |&gt; Example: you have climbed 5 vertical meters and your
last pro is 2.5 meters\\

material.....\\

notes about fall\\

It is certainly possible that this rope could have failed in

what you can do with people and belay devices. If this rope were

the most dangerous form of climbing because people usually have
a static\\
belay and use large diameter high impact force ropes. This rope
was used\\
far in excess of what I would call safe practice. However, I see
this\\
level of use on ropes routinely. I too have used my ropes to this
extent\\
but, I recognize this risk. Understanding the limitations of the
gear is\\
critical here. I would not use a rope with this type of use where
the\\
chance of a high fall factor was high. If I had no choice I would
ensure\\
that my belayer was aware of this and gave a soft belay by allowing
the\\
rope to slip instead of locking it off in the event of a fall.
The point\\
of my message is that people need to be very aware of the gear
they use,\\
the technique they employ, and the abilities of their partners
to also\\
recognize these two issues. I would agree that I am not impressed
with\\
the rope because it broke on the first fall. However, this is
exactly\\
what I expected to see happen. I also expected to see the section

middle fail on the first drop but it held two falls and broke
on the\\
third. I also expected the impact forces on each of these drops
to be in\\
excess of 10 kN and they were really quite close to when the rope
was new.

Here is another example of some "uncontrolled" testing
I have been\\

Last winter Craig Luebben and I conducted some drop tests on
ice. Craig\\
published an article in Climbing Mag on some of these results
and results\\
of his static tests. I have also written an article on static
tests I\\
have conducted in the lab (email me if anyone wants a copy). Anyway,
we\\
set up our tests under the bridge in Ouray. This was in pretty
bad ice\\
actually and for the most part the gear did not hold. Our setup
was with\\
a static belay, a new 10.5 mm BD rope, fall factors in the 1.5
to 1.8\\
range, and 185 pounds of steel. With this setup the only thing
that\\
actually held was a 10 cm screw. Everything else ripped out OR
carabiners\\
broke! I attribute this to the bad ice and that the 10 cm screw
that\\
held was probably in the only good ice we found.

We decided to conduct a series of tests where we used the same
section of\\
rope over again. The first three tests the gear ripped out. On
the\\
fourth drop we about keeled over in disbelief. We had a Snarg
as the test\\
piece connected to the rope with a draw with BD QS2 biners. A
few feet\\
below this was two equalized screws (BD and a Grivel). They were
equalized\\
with a single 24" sling and a locked Big Easy was connected
to the rope.\\
The biner on the snarg broke, the hanger on the Grivel screw sheared
along\\
its long bend, then the big easy locked biner broke! This is three
pieces\\
of hardware that broke on one fall. Now, I am assuming that these
were\\
not defective products (a solid assumption based on my knowledge
of all\\
the gear and the systems to produce it, and a review of the fracture\\
surfaces of the parts we actually recovered). This means that
the forces\\
generated were well in excess of 5000 pounds (multiple times!).
Now the\\
tricky part. Conducting a static test on a new rope with the same
diameter\\
with the same type of knots caused the rope to break in the 3500
pound\\
range. I don't know why the gear broke and why the rope did not.
There\\
was about one hour between drops so the rope had some reasonable
time to\\
recover.

Now the good news. When we placed an ATC in the system (i.e.
some dynamic\\
aspects) every test we conducted held except for a couple of tests
with\\
Spectres.

What does this mean? Dynamic belays are your friend! Climbers
have known\\
this for about a century now. Many climbers today do not understand
this\\
very well. This is why I am relating these types of info to this
news\\
group. I am purposely trying to get this group to discuss this
stuff in\\
detail and learn something from it. So Tom, thanks for your response
and\\
concern.

&gt; 2)Since, "2 sections of rope were cut off (15 feet
from each end)\\
&gt; due to core shots", these results are even worse! .
. . because\\
&gt; I interpret the cutting off of these sections to mean they
had been\\
&gt; thrown away sometime before the testing while it was being
used\\
&gt; by Merill Bitter. The 2 sections apparently were even more
abused\\
&gt; and would have failed well before "7.45 kN (1674 lbf)"
had they\\
&gt; been included in the testing.\\
&gt; How's my logic ?\\
&gt; Tom

Your logic is fine as I can tell. Yes, the two sections Merill
cut off\\
were not tested. These were thrown out (I actually saw one of
them and it\\
was severely abused and had a large core shot). It is certainly
possible\\
that they would have failed at even lower forces. We couldn't
test them\\
because they were too short.

Overall, I am impressed with how well Merill's rope performed.
However, I\\
do think that it was used beyond what was reasonably safe for
the majority\\
of climbers.

It is\\

it up.

Also nonsense. Can't hurt but also absolutely unnecessary.

Sorry David, I really don't think improperly tying a knot is
a good way\\
to test it. *Any* loosely tied knot is simply unsafe and can be
made to\\
fail. A properly set overhand is far stronger than any amount
of force\\
you can generate on rappel, even when an 8mm and 11mm are used
-- I have\\
pull tested this combo and many others.

&gt; We're speculating here but yes, the knot could have been
tied too close to the\\

tail. Or perhaps a\\
&gt; strand of the knot hooked on a rock nubbin or a tree as it
was loaded and\\

None of these scenarios are possible if the overhand is hand\\
tightened...it gets even tighter when you load it and does not
invert. A\\
figure-8 with both ends on one side OTOH *will* invert when loaded\\
(albeit at several hundred lbs.) and should not be used for raps.

I have never heard of a properly tied, and appropriately used,
knot of\\
any type failing in a climbing situation. Operator error has always
been\\
the culprit. If you (or anyone else) knows otherwise, please send

I suspect (sorry, no hard figures) more deaths have resulted

climber tries to jug rope, knot pops loose, climber takes the

There have certainly been countless epics which resulted from

of a\\

triple\\

Nope, I meant what it says...the overhand is the best knot
of all for\\
tying two rappel ropes together at the top. I leave tails at least
9"\\
long and snug the knot as tight as I can. Your so-called standard
knot\\
is much more prone to jamming in cracks, is a pain in the ass
to untie,\\
and certainly doesn't need a backup. BTW I had an 11 mm and 7
mm (worst\\

at about\\
1800 lbs. without slipping. YMMV.

It's a bad idea to connect the bottom of the rappel ropes together;
that\\
prevents them from unwinding and results in nasty tangles. A better
way\\
IMHO is to put big knots in the end of each rope...just don't
use\\
figure-8's and remember to untie them before pulling the rap ;-)

**Re: Three points vs two (cordelettes)**\\
  From: Tim Howe &lt;th3i@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\
Wed Jan 6 14:52:20 1999\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing


I started working out the math for the general case with 3
perfectly\\
equalized anchors onto a loop of known length and discovered it
is a pain\\
in the ass to solve (non-linear, 6 unknowns at last count). So
if someone\\
else wants to do it by hand go for it, otherwise I am going to
wait till\\
the next time I am near a computer with mathematica.

Instead I did it with a bunch of arbitrary restrictions which
should at\\
least give you an idea of what kind of forces we are dealing with.

Assume that you have your anchors placed in a straight line,
equally\\
spaced and that force being applied to the cordelette is perpendicular
to\\
the wall and the line in the direction of force passes through
the center\\
anchor.

D|\\
V\\
A1_______A2 _______A3\\
\ | /\\
\ | /\\
\ | /\\
L1 \ L2| /L1\\
\ | /\\
\ | /\\
\ @| @/\\
\ | /\\
B\\
| F\\
V

these calculations assume that the cordelette is perfectly
equalized, this\\
is very important!!!

note that L1+L1+L2 = L the total length of your cordelette
(Ignore the\\
knot)

we need to know how far the tie in point is from the wall so
solve for L2\\
to get\\
2L +- (4L^2 + 12(L^2 - 4D^2))^1/2\\
L2 = --------------------------------\\
-6

so if you know how far the tie in point (i.e. you as the belayer)
are from\\
the wall (L2) you can calculate L1 = (L - L2) / 2 and from that
calculate\\
the angle @ = arccos(L2/L1).

Since the cordelette is equalized the tension on all the strands
is equal\\
and so their components in the direction of the force must be
equal.

T+2Tcos(@) = F

so

T= F / (1+2cos(@))

so if you had a 20 ft cordelette and had your anchors placed
3 ft apart in\\
a line you would be standing about 6.2ft from the wall. The angle
@ would\\
be a little over 26 degrees and the Tension would be F / 2.8

which means that in a serious fall (5000 lbs) the Tension on
each L would\\
be about 1786 lbs and on each strand (remember they are doubled)
would be\\
893 lbs.

The problem is that even with a good knot or other setup it
is diffucult\\
to get a properly equalized cordelette. and with even a 60 degree
angle\\
you are getting close to the breaking strength of 6mm cord (1200
lbs).

And if one of your anchors blow, forget about it.

It is easier to just get the strong stuff, pay the extra cash,
and live\\
to tell us all about that nice whipper. please feel free to poke
holes in or fun at my calculations.\\
climb safe, cleanup's a bitch

-Tim

&gt;&gt; you are getting close to the breaking strength of
6mm cord (1200 lbs).

&gt; Where did you get your 1200 lbs? REI's catalog says 8
kN for 6mm.\\
&gt; If I did the conversion right, that's 1800 lbs. They say
5 mm cord\\
&gt; is good for 5.6 kN which is 1258 pounds.

From: Tim Howe &lt;th3i@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;\\
sorry this was unclear, I meant that the cord would have to hold
1200 lbs\\
in this case not that it would break at that load.

I noticed that right after I sent it and was wondering if someone
would\\
call me on it. 3 points for you!

in any case a good knot can be expected to hold something like
80% of the\\
breaking strength of the cord. (this of course depends on the
knot, cord\\
flexability, etc. etc.). 80% of 1800 is 1440 lbs. which means
that a\\
brand new cord would only barely hold if one of the anchors worked
free.

note: the cord would break at one of the bends in the knot,
not come\\
untied.

SO3: CAS #[7446-11-9] can be bought from Aldrich ($64.90 for
40 g of\\
99%) and other chemical manufacturers. At room temperature it
exists as\\
a dimer, (SO3)2, in colourless crstalline prisms, which melt at
15\\
degrees (C) and boil at 45 degrees (C). The solid is rapidly decomposed\\
by water to form sulfuric acid.

SO3 is prepared by a contact process, ie by the action of oxygen
on\\
sulfur dioxide in the presence of catalysts such as platinized
asbestos,\\
platinized magnesium sulfate, ferric oxide, or vanadium compounds.
It\\
may be prepared in the lab by heating fuming sulfuric acid and\\
collecting the sublimate in a cooled receiver. Depending on the\\
conditions of condensation (temperature and pressure) there are
three\\
different forms, alpha, beta and gamma with different melting
points and\\
vapour pressures.

It is an intermediate in sulfuric acid manufacture.

Rather than insulting the poster, Charles, you could have pointed
out\\
that the gas most likely released from sulfuric acid is SO2, sulfur\\
dioxide, which does react with water to produce sulfurous acid
(H2SO3),\\
which reacts with organic materials and could damage a rope. However,\\
given the possibly hot conditions in a car, you could also release
SO3\\
which would rapidly recombine with any water to form sulfuric
acid.

&gt; &gt; This S03 gas can diffuse through your nylon bag into
the core of your rope where it could be absorbed by water in the
damp rope.

&gt; Truly your understanding of this process is magical. That

I would suggest that you do not understand the process either,

I don't know where to begin criticizing your claim that a rope's\\

delicate fabrics) in cold water. Dry slowly, and store away from\\

They show a picture of a faucet and scrub brush. I put the

why I buy my stat lines much longer than the final size I want
them.\\
But this is a little too late in your case...good luck.

&gt;Soak it overnight in water to remove lubricants used in
production and\\

sheath \\

I can back Ben up on this. Here the results of some testing
I did a while\\
back. All these are on *static* rope, so the results may not necessarily\\
carry-over to dynamic, but I'd guess that on a dynamic rope, the
sheath would\\
carry *more* of the load than on static, not less (because the
core of a\\
dynamic rope is more elastic, but the sheath is the same). These
are one\\
sample only on each test, so no statistical data, but I think
it still proves\\
Ben's point. I have no idea why the sheath carries so much of
the load.\\
Doesn't really seem to make sense, but there's the test results
to prove it.

failed at: 3900 lb\\

**Subject: Euro Death Knot Testing**\\
Date - Wed Nov 10 16:23:52 1999\\
  From: Tom Moyer &lt;tmoyer@xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing

I know this has been the subject of lots of flaming already, but
since I\\
actually have some information (not that that's really a requirement
for\\
posting on rec.climbing), here goes ...

I learned this weekend at the International Technical Rescue
Symposium\\
that the figure eight version of the Euro Death Knot is being
actively\\
taught to climbers in Canada. I had thought that only the overhand\\
version was in widespread use and that everyone pretty much recognized\\
the figure eight to have the potential to be a really quick trip
to the\\
bottom of the crag.

For those who don't know what this knot is, check out the drawings
at\\
http://www.petzl.com/FRENG/tech/techframe.html

Failure of the figure eight version of this knot has already
caused a\\
fatality in1994 at Seneca Rocks and an accident in 1995 in Salt
Lake.

Both of these knots would politely be called "mis-loaded"
and impolitely\\
would be called, well - the "Euro Death Knot". The failure
mode for the\\
figure eight version is to flip/invert/capsize, which then becomes
the\\
identical twin of the first knot, just with shorter tails. After
enough\\
of these events there are no tails left and the knot fails. Leaving
at\\
least a foot of tail is recommended.

I spent a few hours yesterday in my front yard with a come-a-long
and a\\
load cell to try to get some decent information on this. The results\\
still leave room for plenty of argument. People who don't like
the\\
figure eight will say, "See, it slips at really low loads!"
People who\\
do like it will say, "See, if you dress it right, pretension
it well,\\
and leave long tails, it doesn't fail. Besides, I've been using
it for\\
years and I'm still alive!"

If you're too impatient to wade through the results below,
the short\\
answer is that if you do all those things, you should be ok. My
question\\
is - why would you take the chance? If you're in a situation where
a\\
stuck rope would be catastrophic, use the overhand. It has all
the same\\
advantages and not nearly as much risk.

Be safe - the body we have to scape off the rock may be yours.

Ok - here's the next round of tests. Should add a little more
fuel to the\\
fire...

Some comments:\\
When the overhand inverts, it doesn't really do the same thing
as the 8 does.\\
The 8 flips completely around and it's really obvious. It also
eats a huge\\
chunk of the tails when it does. The overhand kind of twists a
little, some\\
more rope goes through the knot, and the force goes down. Any
time I pulled on\\
the come-a-long and the force went *down* a few hundred pounds
or more, I noted\\
the peak force before it happened. I'm going to change my terms
and call it\\
"rolled" to differentiate it from way the figure-eight
behaves.

As before, all rope breaks (with one exception noted below)
happened at the\\
knot being tested.

Tests 18, 19, and 20 are on double fisherman's knots, pretty
much the gold\\
standard for comparison. As before, the load is on a single strand,
with a\\
figure eight on a bight at each end. For #19 and #20, the double
fisherman's is\\
loose and mis-tied in every way I can think of that you could
still sort of\\
call it a double fisherman's knot. Definitely the worst excuse
for a DFK I've\\
ever seen.

A friend of mine (a Canuck) talked this morning to a director
with the\\
Association of Canadian Mountain Guides and he told me that they
have stopped\\
recommending the figure 8 version. The accepted practice now is
the overhand\\
version, although some folks continue to use the figure 8 style.

It's pretty clear that both versions of the EDK suck if you
don't tie them\\
cleanly and pretension them well.

Yep, your results confirm mine that I posted here several years
ago.\\
There is NO advantage of the fig-8 version. Pity people don't
listen.\\

**Comparative Testing of High Strength Cord**\\
*Tom Moyer, Paul Tusting, Chris Harmston,*\\
*2000 International Technical Rescue Symposium*

Many climbers carry an 18-foot length of accessory cord called
a cordelette for rigging anchors and as a tool for self-rescue
situations. In the past, this cord was usually 7mm Nylon. In recent
years, many climbers have changed to using one of a number of
high-strength materials in smaller diameters. Vectran, Technora,
Spectra, Kevlar, Kevlar/Spectra blends and Spectra/Nylon webbing
are all used for these purposes along with Nylon cord and Nylon
webbing.
