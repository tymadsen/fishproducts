<p>&gt; OK, I'm in need of some wisdom here (yeah, I know this
may not be the best<br>
&gt; place to look). We just returned from Seneca and have been
arguing about<br>
&gt; the best knot to use for a long two-rope double roped rap.
Steve argues<br>
&gt; for the traditional double fisherman's knot with backups.
I maintain that<br>
&gt; a two-rope figure eight (i.e. lay the ropes with the ends
facing the same<br>
&gt; direction and just tie an 8) has advantages when it comes
to pulling it<br>
&gt; down and extricating it from cracks. Sure it looks a bit
wierd. <br>
&gt; Any opinions?<br>
&gt; Charles</p>

<p>This is a frequent topic here and someone will probably disagree
with<br>
me - ignore them they don't know what they are spewing.</p>

<p>You are right, though you can do better. Use an overhand (with
tails<br>
coming out the same side of the knot) since it is simpler and
better<br>
than an eight in for this purpose. Always leave enough tail to
allow<br>
the knot to invert, though this won't happen if you tighten it<br>
properly in the first place. Leaving too much tail is a mistake
- you<br>
don't want to mistake the tails for the working ropes. Check the
knot<br>
before each rappel during multi-pitch descents.</p>

<p>Although the overhand (also figure eight) knot can invert,
it is<br>
plenty strong for rappelling. It is also safer because, as you<br>
mentioned, it is less likely to get hung up during retrieval.</p>

<p><b>(NOTE: The fig. 8 knot described here (lay ends parallel

  &gt; In article &lt;u7ls0i9cq.fsf@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;,<br>
&gt; &gt; As if TR on static rope results in forces on the same
order as lead<br>
&gt; &gt; falls. You'd have to seriously screw up for that to
happen. <br>
&gt; They say (but you know the kind of things that "they"
say) that<br>
&gt; forces of 1000 lbf have been measured at toprope anchors
with<br>
&gt; dynamic rope (whether the belayer "screwed up",
seriously or<br>
&gt; otherwise, I don't know). That's around 4.5kN. What's your
guess as<br>
&gt; to how much static rope would increase that? Double? 9kN
is where<br>
&gt; crossloaded or open-gate biners can be expected to break.
And I'd<br>
&gt; bet double is way too optimistic. If it's as much as quadruple,<br>
&gt; girth hitched slings could break where biner-linked slings
might<br>
&gt; not.</p>

<p>The short answer is that fall force is not linear with free-fall<br>
distance or rope characteristics, and top roping on static rope
won't<br>
result in equipment failure and death. A 200 pound slingshot top<br>
roper will load the anchor with about 660 pounds of force in a
fall<br>
with zero slack, regardless of whether the rope is dynamic, static,<br>
bungee, or steel cable. As you add free-fall, the force felt by
the<br>
anchor starts to depend on the type of rope, but the transition
isn't<br>
all that abrupt for the types of rope that climbers use.</p>

<p>In testing, static ropes appear to be about 3 times as stiff
as<br>
dynamic ropes at body weight loads: the modulus of elasticity
for<br>
static ropes at bodyweight loads is around 16000-20000 lbf/ft/ft,<br>
while dynamic ropes check in around 4000-8000 [Stephen W. Attaway,<br>
Rope System Analysis]. You might expect worst case forces to be
3<br>
times as high for static rope, but testing on Blue Water ropes
[CWIG<br>
Standards Development Basic Research Summary, 1993] shows only
a<br>
factor of 2 for HARD falls. Note that for mild falls, like those<br>
encountered in top-roping, will not result in as large a factor
of<br>
difference between static and dynamic ropes.</p>

<p>For example, the 1000 lbf anchor force fall you mentioned is
easily<br>
generated on dynamic rope under the following conditions: 30 foot
rope<br>
with static belay, 200 lb climber, and 1.5 feet of slack. With
static<br>
rope, these same conditions will result in a force of about 1500<br>
pounds. Note that most belay devices will begin to slip under
these<br>
conditions, reducing the actual force on the anchor. Now increase
the<br>
slack to 6 feet and what do you expect? If you think this body-length<br>
fall on a short static rope will generate dangerously high forces,
you<br>
are mistaken. In fact, these severe static rope TR conditions
will<br>
result in only 1/3 or so more force, about 2000 pounds total on
the<br>
anchor. Even a girth hitch tied in Karl's old supertape would
hold<br>
this.</p>

<p>These numbers assume that ropes behave like springs (an assumption<br>
supported by the literature and verified by my own analysis of
fall<br>
force data), a 200 lb climber, static rope with modulus of elasticity<br>
of 18000 lbf/ft/ft, and a force ratio of 1:0.6 over the carabiner.<br>
The normal laws of physics apply.</p>

<p>Any questions?</p>

<p><b>Subject: Figure 9 Rappel &amp; Tie-In Knot Test</b><br>
  From: ratagonia@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Newsgroups: rec.climbing<br>
Date: Fri, 07 May 1999 00:06:53 GMT</p>

<p>Someone out there proposed the Figure 9 knot as a superior
Rappel Knot. The<br>
loading situation is the same as using your rope tie-in loop as
a belay loop.<br>
A figure 9 knot is like a figure 8, but you go a half-turn further
before<br>
finishing it.</p>

<p>BD Test Doc # TD 15025 4-28-99 Tom Jones</p>

<p>Load Speed 8"/minute. 10mm steel pins top and bottom.</p>

<p>Test was performed using a slightly used 10.5mm Yellow rope.
A figure 9 knot<br>
was tied forming a short loop. Two pins were inserted into the
loop and<br>
pulled apart. Performance was compared to a Figure 8 knot tested
under the<br>
same conditions.</p>

<p>Fig 9 Results: The rope stretched and the knot tightened as
usual. Unlike a<br>
fig 8 knot, the fig 9 does not creep down the free ends - the
knot<br>
essentially has a built in backup knot. Under loading, the knot
"looks like"<br>
two knots - a front knot and a back knot. At about 2900 lbs, the
front knot<br>
inverts over the back knot, and the load drops to about 2700 lbs.
Loading<br>
continues and the load increases fairly smoothly up to 4000 lbs,
where the<br>
sheath breaks on one side. Max load achieved was 4398 lbs. Neglible
creep at<br>
the free ends was experienced.</p>

<p>Fig 8 (with backup knot ) Results: loads up and stretches.
At 1500 lbs, the<br>
knot inverts, and the load drops to about 1000 lbs. Reloads slowly,
but it<br>
creeps along the free ends at a load of about 1000 lbs until it
hits the<br>
backup knot. Then it loads fairly evenly to 4509 lbs where one
side of the<br>
sheath breaks. Max load was 4509 lbs.</p>

<p>My Conclusions:<br>
A. Figure 8 knot should be used with a backup knot.<br>
B. Figure 9 knot is essentially a backed up figure 8.<br>
C. Maybe I'll use a fig 9 next time.</p>

<p><b>Subject: My Dan Osman Rope Failure Analysis</b><br>
  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;<br>
Newsgroups: rec.climbing<br>
Date: Fri, 16 Jul 1999 12:09:11 -0600</p>

<p>I think it is time I spoke up publicly. I have reviewed Dano's
rope in<br>
some detail. My findings and theory support those published by
Kevin<br>
Worrall in Climbing (No 183, March 1999, Pg 90).</p>

<p><b>This statement is mine personally and NOT that of Black
Diamond Equipment!</b><br>
This is obvious as you read below.<br>
<br>
Irrelevant Background: <br>
I am a Materials Engineer with BS degrees in Physics and Materials<br>
Engineering and a ME in Materials Engineering (I nearly finished
a PhD but<br>
bailed once I learned I did not enjoy being a scientist any longer).
I<br>
know lots about atomic layer semiconductor crystal growth. I have
been<br>
the Quality Assurance Manager for Black Diamond Equipment for
6 years. My<br>
primary responsibility is the testing and analysis of climbing
equipment,<br>
among other stuff. I have been involved in the ASTM climbing and<br>
mountaineering standards development for the last 4 years. I investigate<br>
all accidents I hear of involving equipment failure, whether they
are BD's<br>
or not. I review rec.climbing every day looking specifically for
posts<br>
related to accidents, gear, misuses of gear, issues about BD,
etc. I, and<br>
others at BD, go out of our way on this news group to publish
information<br>
above and beyond what is required by the standards that climbing
gear is<br>
designed to (see the recent lame thread on "Gear Safety"
which I will not<br>
respond to specifically. See Karl Lew's web site. Search under
my name<br>
on dejanews for examples). I do not post to this news group as
a general<br>
rule unless I think that posts from various people are specifically
wrong<br>
or misleading, as is the current case (in fact I try to avoid
posting<br>
because of commercial conflict of interest). I respond to individuals
on<br>
this news group constantly and my comments to these people come
back into<br>
this group (see the current RP thread on soldering cable fatigue).
I<br>
respond in detail to individuals who ask me questions, even when
they do<br>
not like what BD is about (see recent Camalot threads and failure
analysis<br>
associated with this thread).</p>

<p>Even more irrelevant background:<br>
I have been rock climbing since 1981, and am primarily a trad
climber. I<br>
am a risk taker because I climb. Climbing IS dangerous and anyone
who<br>
thinks otherwise if fooling themselves. Anyone who climbs is a
risk taker<br>
in my opinion. I climb 5.12 on any rock type (that I have been
on) and<br>
style (except offwidth, so far) and have onsighted up to 12c/d.
I climb<br>
WI6 and possibly harder (ice is either hard or easy to me and
is my<br>
primary passion). I climb M8. I establish new rock, ice and mixed<br>
routes ground up with and without bolts. I have no aid or alpine<br>
experience. I weight 190 lbs and take upside-down 40 to 60 footers<br>
without my helmet on. I have nearly killed myself several times
due to<br>
falling off 5.8. I am a climber, climbing eventually involves
falling,<br>
which may very well kill or maim me. Most people, including myself,
would<br>
consider me to be reckless because of how I climb. I climb for
my own<br>
reasons and no one else's. I don't care what people think about
me in<br>
general. Why Dano jumped off cliffs is his own personal choice
that<br>
nobody has a right to argue against, even if he had children in
my<br>
opinion. I certainly have no right to judge his reasons for doing
what he<br>
did. I respect Dano for pushing the limits way way beyond where
they had<br>
been previously. I met Dano twice but did not know him. I know
many of<br>
his friends.</p>

<p>Relevant Background:<br>
My expertise in the analysis of broken climbing ropes is very
limited.<br>
This is due to the fact that climbing ropes very rarely break
or cut in<br>
actual use. The only previous experience I have with rope failure<br>
analysis was that of Matt Baxter who died on El Cap several years
ago when<br>
his rope was cut by a flake after a carabiner had broken (see
dejanews for<br>
more info on this, send a Freedom of Information Request to the
NPS-I<br>
recommend you do it for the Dano accident as well and then you
can have a<br>
copy of my official report, or look at ANAM). I have also reviewed<br>
several ropes with sheaths shredded due to the open back regular
carabiner<br>
gates in minor axis. This lack of experience could indicate that
my<br>
findings are incorrect or suspect.</p>

<p>I first became involved in Dano's accident when news of Dano's
death<br>
spread across this news group with the associated rumors that
the NPS<br>
might have purposely cut his rope. On December 9, 1998 I sent
an email to<br>
John Dill (YOSAR director) letting him know of these rumors on
this news<br>
group and offered my assistance in the analysis of Dano's equipment.
John<br>
responded back that Yosemite Law Enforcement (YLE) was investigating
the<br>
accident and that they had to finish their investigation before
I might be<br>
able to see the ropes (they too knew of the rumors of murder and
were<br>
investigating this as well I suspect). As you all should know
Dan's ropes<br>
stayed on the wall for over a month and YLE was unable to recover
them.<br>
Given the rumors of tampering by the NPS a climber took matters
into his<br>
own hands. He recovered the ropes and sent them directly to BD.
As soon<br>
as I received the ropes I contacted YLE because I was in possession
of<br>
stolen federal evidence from an active investigation. I was told
to<br>
return the ropes immediately and reveal the name of the person
who sent me<br>
the ropes. While on the phone with the lead investigator another
phone<br>
call came into BD from "someone within YLE" stating
that the FBI would be<br>
at BD to arrest me if I did not send the ropes back the next day.
I was<br>
freaking out to say the least. Meanwhile I looked at the rope
in some<br>
detail. It was melted through. It looked as if there were the<br>
possibility that someone had hot cut the rope. When I called YLE
back and<br>
told them this they wanted me to conduct my full investigation
and allowed<br>
me to keep the rope for two weeks. No FBI showed up to haul me
away.</p>

<p>Analysis:</p>

<p>I only saw the one section of rope that was cut down and contained
the<br>
failure point. I did not see the rigging, retrieval rope, or the
section<br>
that was attached to Dan directly.</p>

<p>Everything I did was visual examination. I did not untie any
knot or<br>
tamper with the rope in any way other than prying the knots to
see inside.<br>
With some insight from Doug Heinrich I concluded that the failure
of Dan's<br>
rope was not due to tensile overload or from being tampered with.
I<br>
strongly believe that Dan did miscalculate on his last jump. For
some<br>
reason he moved his jump site. In doing so he crossed the ropes
(either<br>
on the retrieval line or on the main jump line). When he jumped
the first<br>
knot above the one he was tied in with slid down a section of
rope several<br>
lengths up. The sheath was heavily melted and removed in several
sections<br>
on this upper part of the rope. The knot that slid down the rope
was<br>
melted in multiple locations and was melted nearly completely
through,<br>
deep inside the knot. This knot was not tight, yet others in the
system<br>
were (this is the one open question that is unresolved as far
as I know).<br>
It is my conclusion that Dan's rope was cut by his own rope sliding<br>
against itself. Use of a magnifying glass indicated to me that
the cut<br>
surface was due to sliding action in one direction. There was
no evidence<br>
of hot cutting with a knife or other type of instrument. I conducted<br>
further experiments in my lab to see if tensile overload could
have caused<br>
this failure. The samples I tested were significantly different
in that<br>
they were heavily frayed and tattered. My analysis of Dan's ropes
in<br>
general was that they were in great condition. There was no evidence
to<br>
me of damage due to previous falls, uv exposure, or weather. I
would have<br>
climbed on these ropes without any hesitation had they not been
from this<br>
accident. I do not believe that the condition of the ropes had
anything<br>
at all to do with the failure of the ropes. Nor do I believe that
Dan's<br>
basic shock absorbing setup was incorrect. Crossing the ropes
was the<br>
problem.</p>

<p>I was asked by YLE not to make my findings public until they
had finished<br>
their criminal investigation. They forced me to tell them who
sent me the<br>
rope and they pressed charges against this individual (I will
have to live<br>
with the fact that I was unable to keep this information confidential).
I<br>
still have not heard back from YLE about closure of this accident
and<br>
decided to make my findings public now due to the vast numbers
of<br>
misinformed posts relative to this subject. Maybe my analysis
will stop<br>
some of the useless bickering many of you are currently engaged
in.</p>

<p>Conclusions:<br>
What is to be learned from this accident? NEVER LET NYLON SLIDE
AGAINST<br>
NYLON! You should already know this.</p>

<p>I also know that Dano's rigging setup was reviewed by more
than a couple<br>
of technically competent people. I also know that he tested it
multiple<br>
times. I personally do not think that what Dan was doing (when
done<br>
properly as he had done on earlier jumps) was any more dangerous
than<br>
modern ice climbers doing hard thin ice routes (like in Maple
Canyon and<br>
elsewhere), in fact his setup was most likely safer in my personal<br>
opinion. Dan's death was a tragedy and an accident.</p>

<p><b>Subject: Test Report - Fig 8 Tie In Knot</b><br>
  From: ratagonia@xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Newsgroups: rec.climbing<br>
Date: Fri, 22 Jan 1999 23:02:50 GMT<br>
<br>
I tested a figure 8 as a tie in knot using the test machine at
Black Diamond.<br>
This was to see how strong the 'belay loop' formed by your tie
in knot is.</p>

<p>Rope: slightly used 9.7mm single rope<br>
Knot: follow through figure 8 like when tieing in<br>
Date: Dec 16, 1998</p>

<p>Setup: pulled at 4"/minute. Pulled as a loop with the
knot in the center of<br>
one of the strands. Used 1" pins both ends.</p>

<p>Results: Knot loads steadily and tightens up to 2200 lbf. At
this point, the<br>
knot starts to roll, and the force drops to 1500 lbf. Then the
stiff end of<br>
the rope where it is taped started to get sucked into the knot,
and the<br>
rolling action stops. Load increased steadily to 4050 lbf, where
the sheath<br>
on the non-knot side broke. Force drops to 3400 lbf. Load increased
steadily<br>
to 4050 lbf, where the sheath on the knot side, upper strand broke.
Force<br>
drops to 3750 lbf. Load increased steadily to 4884 lbf, where
the core broke<br>
at the knot, breaking the loop.</p>

<p>Conclusions: Figure 8 knot can roll in this loading configuration
( belay<br>
loop on harness or when used as quick rappel knot ) at a load
on the order of<br>
1500 - 2000 lbs. It will continue to roll until some mechanism
stops it. A<br>
backup knot on a figure 8 in a pulled-apart loading configuration
actual does<br>
something. I will use these from now on when rappelling. Ultimate

<p>Additional Comments:<br>
One data sample only gives you a general idea of what is going
on. Loads for<br>
rolling and for breaking can be expected to vary quite a bit with
rope size,<br>
surface conditions and loading sequence. Having one side jammed
up against a<br>
chain or rappel ring may also effect this. Take this with a grain

<p>Here is some test data from an investigation I conducted last
summer.<br>
Ropes were provided by a customer who was asking similar questions
as you<br>
all are.</p>

<p>All ropes were used slightly. I conducted a pull test on a
loop of rope<br>
with an overhand followthrough knot (used this knot to minimize
knot<br>
tightening and test machine travel). I did not conduct drop tests
because<br>
we do not have this capability at this time.</p>

<p>1) 1986 Chouinard 8.8 mm. 3240 lbf @ knot. (this is a half
rope)<br>
2) 1986 Chouinard 11 mm. 5944 lbf @ knot.<br>
3) 25 year old 11 mm Edelrid. 5141 lbf @ knot.</p>

<p>Conclusions. Don't know how strong these ropes were when new.
Single<br>
strand strength of these ropes is conservatively half the loop
strength<br>
(big assumption on my part). I would say this is pretty good overall.
I<br>
do not know what the dynamic properties of these ropes were nor
do I know<br>
how time affects the dynamic properties. My recommendation to
the<br>
customer was to not take any chances with the ropes in lead climbing.
I<br>
would use them for top roping without any reservations.</p>

<p>Data from a test I conducted on 12/22/98 (research into Dan
Osman's failed<br>
rope--to be published later so don't ask questions about this
right now<br>
please). Loop, knot was a quad followthrough figure 8 (I have
a new<br>
machine now and can test with longer travel).</p>

<p>All ropes are BD ropes. New condition 1997 ropes.</p>

<p>1) 11 mm. 6643 lbf @ knot.<br>
2) 11 mm. 6803 lbf @ knot.<br>
3) 10 mm. 4596 lbf @ knot.<br>
4) 10 mm. 4765 lbf @ knot.<br>
5) 10 mm. 4952 lbf @ knot.</p>

<p>Conclusions: very strong.</p>

<p>My Conclusions and Recommendations. Rope strength does not
appear to<br>
decrease with time. I don't trust old ropes because I do not know
how the<br>
elastic properties change with time. This needs further research.

I would have to forget to add the important fact that I tested
all my<br>
samples over 3 inch diameter steel pulley's, duh!. Had I tested
over 10<br>
mm diameter pins the failure would have been lower and would have
been at<br>
the pin as Mr. Davis has observed in his tests. Thanks for asking

<p>Interesting POV... and you are right. A rope loses its'<br>
ability to withstand the force of a fall in somthing other than
a<br>
linear manner; however, I am not sure that it can be expressed<br>
exponentially, either. After the very FIRST fall (let's use<br>
factor 2 as an example, since the UIAA tests are rather close
to<br>
that) a rope will lose much of its' elasticity, thereby SUDDENLY<br>
losing much of it's capacity for force absorption. After that
one<br>
fall, the rope loses less elasticity with each fall (there's less<br>
to lose!), and what is happening during the rest of the drops
is<br>
that the fibers are taking the damage. This is nearly impossible<br>
to quantify, though, since the fibers are ameliorating this<br>
damage randomly over a long length of rope.<br>
Take this concept to your climbing rope and it gets even<br>
less definable, since you (probably) fall on a different length<br>
of rope each time with a different fall factor...<br>

at<br>
&gt; the high point.</p>

<p>There is some validity to this but it is minor to other factors.
FWIW<br>
all of the rope companies send their dry ropes for the UIAA<br>
certification because they yield slightly lower impact forces
and one to<br>
two extra drops over the standard ropes. This is due to the lubricity
of<br>
the dry treatement. The effect is greatly diminshed once the ropes
get<br>
dirty.</p>

<p>&gt; With a dynamic rope, the implication is that the section
of<br>
&gt; rope closest to the climber will undergo the most stress,
and<br>
&gt; (barring defects or damage) the rope will always break (if
ever)<br>
&gt; on the climber's side of the rope.</p>

<p>This is absolutely true. The difference between the theoretical
fall<br>
factor and the effective fall factor is significant but is's mostly
due<br>
to friction in the system. It's not practical to calculate however
so<br>
nobody does. In the drop test, the rope always breaks at the orifice.</p>

<p>&gt; More interesting, perhaps it is this factor (if it is)
that<br>
&gt; is more responsible for the differences in impact experienced
by<br>
&gt; the climber and the belayer, than friction at the high point<br>
&gt; carabiner is...</p>

<p>Don't think so. Friction is the main culprit not only at the
top biner<br>
but all those below it and rope against rock.</p>

<p>&gt; If the rope is in fact pinching itself at the high poin<br>
&gt; carabiner, then another implication is that fall factor is<br>
&gt; misunderstoodd as it applies to overall effects on rope<br>
&gt; damage.</p>

<p>Hell most climber's don't understand fall factors enough to
be able to<br>
misunderstand them.</p>

<p>&gt; Also, is there efectively a higher fall factor<br>
&gt; experienced by the climber's side of the rope than the belayer's?</p>

<p>True.</p>

<p>&gt; No, friction is unrelated to fall factor. Friction in
the system<br>
&gt; occurs because of<br>
&gt; 1. Friction of the rope running over the top karabiner<br>
&gt; 2. Slippage of the rope through the belay device<br>
&gt; This reduces the effective impact force in the system. Even
the<br>
&gt; harnesses worn by both the leader and belayer contributes
to reducing<br>
&gt; the impact force.</p>

<p>Actually the effective impact force on the climber will always
be higher<br>
in the real world than the theoretical impact force because of
friction.<br>
The friction over rock and through each carabiner reduces the
ropes<br>
ability to absorb the force of a fall. IOW, you may fall on 20m
of rope<br>
but are only getting the equivalent of say 15m that is catching
the<br>
fall. What this really means is all the formulas are worthless
from a<br>
practical standpoint. BTW tests have shown the effect of harnesses
and<br>
knots is minimal at best.</p>

<p>Stop right there. The problem has nothing to do with the rope

and strong<br>
&gt; vinegar do not damage ropes . Urine dropped the number of

&gt; the standard test drops by 50%.</p>

<p>Old news but it doesn't seem like a good idea to soak your
rope in gas<br>
anyways (what about all the additives?). Acid is the big no-no.</p>

<p>&gt; 2) "An American product (Sharpie) specifically sold
for marking the middle<br>

of marking<br>

edge) by as much<br>
&gt; as 50%."</p>

<p>Actually Sharpies are not marketed for marking ropes (can you
say<br>
"liability" ;-) and it even says on the pen "not
for cloth." The only<br>
pen I know of sold for ropes is Bluewaters and they control the
solvent<br>
used.</p>

<p>&gt; 3) "It appears it is not possible to damage ropes
by walking on them with<br>

walking on the<br>

<p>Yep, but I still don't like someone walking on *my* lifeline.</p>

<p>&gt; 4)... "wet or iced ropes experience a major drop
in edge strength (falls<br>
&gt; for half rope go from 9 to 3) regardless of whether they
are dry treated<br>
&gt; or not."</p>

<p>There is no official edge test so stuff like this has to be
taken with a<br>
grain of salt. The bigger question is what happens to impact forces?</p>

<p>&gt; 5) Recent comparison testing of climbing ropes among various
labs<br>
&gt; has shown that the results are all over the map (up to 100%)
on a variety<br>
&gt; of parameters.</p>

<p>I reported this years ago and Mammut/Edelrid recently showed
how<br>
pervasive the problem is. The UIAA never calibrated/cross-checked
the<br>
official labs, duh. It basically means the reported stats are
not<br>
reliable between brands until the UIAA gets their act together.
Some<br>
companies have been accused of manipulating the data for marketing
but<br>
there is no way to verify this. Caveat Emptor.</p>

<p>&gt; 6) Ropes used for top roping lose strength over an edge
very quickly. "They<br>
&gt; should not be used for field work."</p>

<p>No surprise. Same reason sport climbing is so hard on ropes.</p>

<p>&gt; 7) The official position of the Safety Commission regarding
rope use for<br>
&gt; glacier travel is that one strand of a half rope or twin
rope is perfectly<br>
&gt; adequate.</p>

<p>Taking a break from my deadline. Bah humbug.</p>

<p>&gt;I understand that rope ages but by<br>

that evaporate<br>
&gt; with time and temperature. My understanding of nylons are
that they do not<br>
&gt; need plasticisers and therefore only age when the long chains
are broken by<br>
&gt; chemicals or UV light.</p>

<p>They do use plasticizers in nylon but it depends on the application.<br>
Case in point: high-quality sunglass frames (eg. Vuarnet) are
made of<br>
"French" nylon which has a much higher plasticizer content
than the<br>
cheap drugstore variety (also nylon) that are prone to snapping,<br>
especially after a year. This material does leach out with time.<br>
Research has shown that UV degradation is less of a factor in
climbing<br>
ropes than ozone.</p>

<p>&gt; The following is an excerpt from BlueWater's web page;<br>
&gt; "Shelf life Although there is no conclusive evidence
from nylon<br>
&gt; manufacturers, we recommend the shelf life of an unused rope
to be five<br>
&gt; years."<br>
&gt; It maybe that some softeners/plasticisers are used or that
the polymers<br>
&gt; breakdone by other means. If I find any further information
I'll post it'<br>
&gt; in the mean time does any one else have any thing to add?</p>

<p>The polyamid used in ropes is nylon 6,6 but that is just part
of the<br>
recipe, there are additives (UV inhibitors, dyes, etc.) and coatings<br>
applied as well. Testing the raw material has little meaning to
a final<br>
rope, hence BW' statement. Much of a rope's characteristics are<br>
determined by twisting of the core fibers and the all-important
heat<br>
set. This cooking of the rope stabilizes the nylon (it shrinks)
but it<br>
is hardly permanent.</p>

5.14 and has put up numerous 5.12 trad routes in the area. The

<p>2 sections of rope were cut off (15 feet from each end) due
to core shots<br>

<p>I took Merill's rope and had it tested according to the UIAA/CEN
rope<br>
standards. Two tests were done. One from the end of the rope and
one<br>
from the middle of the rope. I thank BEAL Cordes for this testing.</p>

<p>The UIAA test is a 1.78 fall factor with 178 lbs. This is an
extremely<br>
hard fall with static belay!</p>

<p>Sample 1 (end of the rope).<br>
Number of falls to cause failure: 1<br>
Impact Force 7.45 kN (1674 lbf)</p>

<p>Sample 2 (middle of the rope).<br>
Number of falls to cause failure: 3<br>
Impact Force on 1st drop 7.41 kN<br>
Impact Force on 2nd drop 9.20 kN<br>
Impact Force on 3rd drop 10.45 kN.</p>

<p>This demonstrates that the impact force increases rapidly with
repeated<br>
falls. It also shows that this rope performed very well considering
the<br>
amount of use it has seen. I certainly don't recommend that anyone
use a<br>
rope to this extreme. When new these ropes would hold between
7 and 10<br>
falls and the impact forces on the first drop were in the 6.5
kN range.<br>
It is amazing that the impact forces on this rope are as low as
they are.<br>
Note, BD ropes have some of the lowest impact forces on the market
(our<br>
ropes are manufactured by Beal and PMI) so don't assume that your
rope<br>
will perform the same as this one has. Lower impact force ropes
equate to<br>
lower forces on the gear which increases the probability that
the gear<br>
will hold the fall. Note, the impact force is that felt by the
"climber"<br>
or the tension in the rope. The protection would have felt about
1.6<br>
times the force stated. For the third fall above the protection
would<br>
have felt about 3700 pounds of force (greater than 16 kN) which
is more<br>
than enough to break stoppers, Camalot Jr's, carabiners in open
or closed<br>
gate, etc. In real life the forces will be significantly lower
due to<br>
energy absorbtion due to belay device slippage (friction), two
bodys<br>
involved instead of steel and a static belay. FWIW.</p>

<p>&gt; I'd be reluctant to accept that low ff falls do no damage

&gt; Here's why:<br>
&gt; First of all factor 1 falls are pretty severe. I don't recall
the<br>
&gt; estimates I've made, but the tension produced in the rope
is<br>
&gt; significantly more than half the tension in a factor 2 fall.
The<br>
&gt; nylon doesn't absorb as much energy per fall, but it seems
likely<br>
&gt; that some inelastic work is done in factor 1 falls. If I
took<br>
&gt; multiple falls close to factor 1, I'd start thinking about
a new<br>
&gt; rope.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Secondly, the last time I checked, manufacturers said they
did not<br>
&gt; have a good understanding of what happens to a rope that
has<br>
&gt; sustained many moderate falls, and I haven't seen any guidelines<br>
&gt; that cover this use. Concern over this has been expressed,
though.<br>
&gt; Maybe manufactureres have new recommendations on this subject
- if<br>
&gt; so, I'd love to hear them.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; One thing is clear: After holding a fall, a rope's shock-absorbency<br>
&gt; is reduced, though it may be (partially) restored if allowed
to<br>
&gt; rest. It has been hypothesized that this reduction in<br>
&gt; shock-absorbency has contributed to the breaking of carabiners
that<br>
&gt; occasionally occurs during falls. Even if the rope doesn't
break<br>
&gt; (climbing rope failure is, after all, extraordinarily rare),
an worn<br>
&gt; out rope might contribute to an accident.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; There is one thing I do agree with wholeheartedly: Use your<br>
&gt; judgement. Retiring a rope is cheap compared to serious injury
or<br>
&gt; death, but, fortunately, these are not often caused by rope
failure.<br>

&gt; |&gt; But how can you transpose this number of fall on the
terrain? The number of<br>
&gt; |&gt; falls refers to the fall factor. A fall of factor 1
means that the length<br>

you from your belayer.<br>
&gt; |&gt; Example: you have climbed 5 vertical meters and your

&gt; though.<br>
&gt; I am not impressed at all.</p>

<p>It is certainly possible that this rope could have failed in
the field. I<br>
doubt it because of the fact that the UIAA setup is far more severe
than<br>
what you can do with people and belay devices. If this rope were
used for<br>
aid soloing then I would be very concerned. Aid soloing in my
opinion is<br>
the most dangerous form of climbing because people usually have
a static<br>
belay and use large diameter high impact force ropes. This rope
was used<br>
far in excess of what I would call safe practice. However, I see
this<br>
level of use on ropes routinely. I too have used my ropes to this
extent<br>
but, I recognize this risk. Understanding the limitations of the
gear is<br>
critical here. I would not use a rope with this type of use where
the<br>
chance of a high fall factor was high. If I had no choice I would
ensure<br>
that my belayer was aware of this and gave a soft belay by allowing
the<br>
rope to slip instead of locking it off in the event of a fall.
The point<br>
of my message is that people need to be very aware of the gear
they use,<br>
the technique they employ, and the abilities of their partners
to also<br>
recognize these two issues. I would agree that I am not impressed
with<br>
the rope because it broke on the first fall. However, this is
exactly<br>
what I expected to see happen. I also expected to see the section
in the<br>
middle fail on the first drop but it held two falls and broke
on the<br>
third. I also expected the impact forces on each of these drops
to be in<br>
excess of 10 kN and they were really quite close to when the rope
was new.</p>

<p>Here is another example of some "uncontrolled" testing
I have been<br>
involved with.</p>

<p>Last winter Craig Luebben and I conducted some drop tests on
ice. Craig<br>
published an article in Climbing Mag on some of these results
and results<br>
of his static tests. I have also written an article on static
tests I<br>
have conducted in the lab (email me if anyone wants a copy). Anyway,
we<br>
set up our tests under the bridge in Ouray. This was in pretty
bad ice<br>
actually and for the most part the gear did not hold. Our setup
was with<br>
a static belay, a new 10.5 mm BD rope, fall factors in the 1.5
to 1.8<br>
range, and 185 pounds of steel. With this setup the only thing
that<br>
actually held was a 10 cm screw. Everything else ripped out OR
carabiners<br>
broke! I attribute this to the bad ice and that the 10 cm screw
that<br>
held was probably in the only good ice we found.</p>

<p>We decided to conduct a series of tests where we used the same
section of<br>
rope over again. The first three tests the gear ripped out. On
the<br>
fourth drop we about keeled over in disbelief. We had a Snarg
as the test<br>
piece connected to the rope with a draw with BD QS2 biners. A
few feet<br>
below this was two equalized screws (BD and a Grivel). They were
equalized<br>
with a single 24" sling and a locked Big Easy was connected
to the rope.<br>
The biner on the snarg broke, the hanger on the Grivel screw sheared
along<br>
its long bend, then the big easy locked biner broke! This is three
pieces<br>
of hardware that broke on one fall. Now, I am assuming that these
were<br>
not defective products (a solid assumption based on my knowledge
of all<br>
the gear and the systems to produce it, and a review of the fracture<br>
surfaces of the parts we actually recovered). This means that
the forces<br>
generated were well in excess of 5000 pounds (multiple times!).
Now the<br>
tricky part. Conducting a static test on a new rope with the same
diameter<br>
with the same type of knots caused the rope to break in the 3500
pound<br>
range. I don't know why the gear broke and why the rope did not.
There<br>
was about one hour between drops so the rope had some reasonable
time to<br>
recover.</p>

<p>Now the good news. When we placed an ATC in the system (i.e.
some dynamic<br>
aspects) every test we conducted held except for a couple of tests
with<br>
Spectres.</p>

<p>What does this mean? Dynamic belays are your friend! Climbers
have known<br>
this for about a century now. Many climbers today do not understand
this<br>
very well. This is why I am relating these types of info to this
news<br>
group. I am purposely trying to get this group to discuss this
stuff in<br>
detail and learn something from it. So Tom, thanks for your response
and<br>
concern.</p>

<p>&gt; 2)Since, "2 sections of rope were cut off (15 feet
from each end)<br>
&gt; due to core shots", these results are even worse! .
. . because<br>
&gt; I interpret the cutting off of these sections to mean they
had been<br>
&gt; thrown away sometime before the testing while it was being
used<br>
&gt; by Merill Bitter. The 2 sections apparently were even more
abused<br>
&gt; and would have failed well before "7.45 kN (1674 lbf)"
had they<br>
&gt; been included in the testing.<br>
&gt; How's my logic ?<br>
&gt; Tom</p>

<p>Your logic is fine as I can tell. Yes, the two sections Merill
cut off<br>
were not tested. These were thrown out (I actually saw one of
them and it<br>
was severely abused and had a large core shot). It is certainly
possible<br>
that they would have failed at even lower forces. We couldn't
test them<br>
because they were too short.</p>

<p>Overall, I am impressed with how well Merill's rope performed.
However, I<br>
do think that it was used beyond what was reasonably safe for
the majority<br>
of climbers.</p>

<p>In a word: nonsense. IMHO the single bowline backed up is the

while<br>
mildy hypothermic. It is easy to loosen after numerous falls on
a sport<br>
route. It is more than strong enough, easy to visually check on
a<br>
partner from a distance, and plenty bombproof *if tied properly.*
It is<br>
less bulky and uses less rope than other tie-in knots.</p>

<p>&gt;Even when tying in with a figure eight you need to back
it up.</p>

<p>Also nonsense. Can't hurt but also absolutely unnecessary.</p>

&gt; I don't use an overhand myself but my curiosity was piqued
by yesterday's NPS<br>

see what could<br>

heard it can<br>
&gt; "invert" under pressure. So I loosely tied one,
put pressure on it and saw two<br>
&gt; of the strands distort. I gave them a bit of help to invert
them and guess<br>
&gt; what I ended up with? Another overhand knot!<br>
&gt; However, this one was a little closer to the tails. I inverted
that one and<br>
&gt; the new knot was right on the tails and fell apart when loaded.</p>

<p>Sorry David, I really don't think improperly tying a knot is
a good way<br>
to test it. *Any* loosely tied knot is simply unsafe and can be
made to<br>
fail. A properly set overhand is far stronger than any amount
of force<br>
you can generate on rappel, even when an 8mm and 11mm are used
-- I have<br>
pull tested this combo and many others.</p>

<p>&gt; We're speculating here but yes, the knot could have been
tied too close to the<br>
&gt; tails, as you suggested, or even tied to close to just one
tail. Or perhaps a<br>
&gt; strand of the knot hooked on a rock nubbin or a tree as it
was loaded and<br>
&gt; loosened during the rappel.</p>

<p>None of these scenarios are possible if the overhand is hand<br>
tightened...it gets even tighter when you load it and does not
invert. A<br>
figure-8 with both ends on one side OTOH *will* invert when loaded<br>
(albeit at several hundred lbs.) and should not be used for raps.</p>

<p>I have never heard of a properly tied, and appropriately used,
knot of<br>
any type failing in a climbing situation. Operator error has always
been<br>
the culprit. If you (or anyone else) knows otherwise, please send
me the<br>
documentation.</p>

<p>I suspect (sorry, no hard figures) more deaths have resulted
from stuck<br>
rappel ropes than knots coming untied. Bulky knot gets jammed
in crack,<br>
climber tries to jug rope, knot pops loose, climber takes the
big ride.<br>
There have certainly been countless epics which resulted from
stuck<br>
ropes, quite a few of which could have been prevented by a better
knot<br>
and rope management.</p>

&gt; Hello Rock and Ice,<br>
&gt; I was enjoying my newly arrived copy of R&amp;I #76 and came<br>
&gt; across a bit of information that could be very dangerous
if interpreted<br>
&gt; incorrectly by lesser experienced climbers. On page 114,
in the midst<br>
&gt; of a rope comparison article, is a group of 3 photos of two
ropes tied<br>
&gt; with an overhand knot. The accompanying text says, "The
Overhand Knot is<br>
&gt; the best choice for joining two rappel ropes.,etc..."<br>
&gt; I assume the meaning of this statement is to use the overhand<br>
&gt; knot to join the LOOSE ends(to prevent rapping off of the
ends) and not<br>
&gt; the UPPER ends of the ropes as would be required at the top
of a<br>
&gt; two-rope rappel; the current standard being the double or
triple<br>
&gt; fishermen's knot(sometimes called the grapevine knot) backed
up by<br>
&gt; knotting the tails also.</p>

<p>Nope, I meant what it says...the overhand is the best knot
of all for<br>
tying two rappel ropes together at the top. I leave tails at least
9"<br>
long and snug the knot as tight as I can. Your so-called standard
knot<br>
is much more prone to jamming in cracks, is a pain in the ass
to untie,<br>
and certainly doesn't need a backup. BTW I had an 11 mm and 7
mm (worst<br>
likely case) connected with an overhand and they finally broke
at about<br>
1800 lbs. without slipping. YMMV.</p>

<p>It's a bad idea to connect the bottom of the rappel ropes together;
that<br>
prevents them from unwinding and results in nasty tangles. A better
way<br>
IMHO is to put big knots in the end of each rope...just don't
use<br>
figure-8's and remember to untie them before pulling the rap ;-)</p>

It's a fantastic knot- easy to tie, easy to untie, safe, and less

up on edges. I wrapped many pitches with a haul bag with this

Sure, other knots are just as good but can take longer to tie/untie,

<p>I started working out the math for the general case with 3
perfectly<br>
equalized anchors onto a loop of known length and discovered it
is a pain<br>
in the ass to solve (non-linear, 6 unknowns at last count). So
if someone<br>
else wants to do it by hand go for it, otherwise I am going to
wait till<br>
the next time I am near a computer with mathematica.</p>

<p>Instead I did it with a bunch of arbitrary restrictions which
should at<br>
least give you an idea of what kind of forces we are dealing with.</p>

<p>Assume that you have your anchors placed in a straight line,
equally<br>
spaced and that force being applied to the cordelette is perpendicular
to<br>
the wall and the line in the direction of force passes through
the center<br>
anchor.<br>
<br>
D|<br>
V<br>
A1_______A2 _______A3<br>
\ | /<br>
\ | /<br>

L1 \ L2| /L1<br>
\ | /<br>
\ | /<br>
\ @| @/<br>
\ | /<br>
B<br>
| F<br>
V</p>

<p>these calculations assume that the cordelette is perfectly
equalized, this<br>
is very important!!!</p>

<p>note that L1+L1+L2 = L the total length of your cordelette
(Ignore the<br>
knot)</p>

<p>we need to know how far the tie in point is from the wall so
solve for L2<br>
to get<br>
2L +- (4L^2 + 12(L^2 - 4D^2))^1/2<br>
L2 = --------------------------------<br>
-6</p>

<p>so if you know how far the tie in point (i.e. you as the belayer)
are from<br>
the wall (L2) you can calculate L1 = (L - L2) / 2 and from that
calculate<br>
the angle @ = arccos(L2/L1).</p>

<p>Since the cordelette is equalized the tension on all the strands
is equal<br>
and so their components in the direction of the force must be
equal.</p>

<p>T+2Tcos(@) = F</p>

<p>so</p>

<p>T= F / (1+2cos(@))</p>

<p>so if you had a 20 ft cordelette and had your anchors placed
3 ft apart in<br>
a line you would be standing about 6.2ft from the wall. The angle
@ would<br>
be a little over 26 degrees and the Tension would be F / 2.8</p>

<p>which means that in a serious fall (5000 lbs) the Tension on
each L would<br>
be about 1786 lbs and on each strand (remember they are doubled)
would be<br>
893 lbs.</p>

<p>The problem is that even with a good knot or other setup it
is diffucult<br>
to get a properly equalized cordelette. and with even a 60 degree
angle<br>
you are getting close to the breaking strength of 6mm cord (1200
lbs).</p>

<p>And if one of your anchors blow, forget about it.</p>

<p>It is easier to just get the strong stuff, pay the extra cash,
and live<br>
to tell us all about that nice whipper. please feel free to poke
holes in or fun at my calculations.<br>
climb safe, cleanup's a bitch</p>

<p>-Tim</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; you are getting close to the breaking strength of
6mm cord (1200 lbs).</p>

<p>&gt; Where did you get your 1200 lbs? REI's catalog says 8
kN for 6mm.<br>
&gt; If I did the conversion right, that's 1800 lbs. They say
5 mm cord<br>
&gt; is good for 5.6 kN which is 1258 pounds.</p>

<p>From: Tim Howe &lt;th3i@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;<br>
sorry this was unclear, I meant that the cord would have to hold
1200 lbs<br>
in this case not that it would break at that load.</p>

<p>I noticed that right after I sent it and was wondering if someone
would<br>
call me on it. 3 points for you!</p>

<p>in any case a good knot can be expected to hold something like
80% of the<br>
breaking strength of the cord. (this of course depends on the
knot, cord<br>
flexability, etc. etc.). 80% of 1800 is 1440 lbs. which means
that a<br>
brand new cord would only barely hold if one of the anchors worked
free.</p>

<p>note: the cord would break at one of the bends in the knot,
not come<br>
untied.</p>

quote them.</p>

<p>SO3: CAS #[7446-11-9] can be bought from Aldrich ($64.90 for
40 g of<br>
99%) and other chemical manufacturers. At room temperature it
exists as<br>
a dimer, (SO3)2, in colourless crstalline prisms, which melt at
15<br>
degrees (C) and boil at 45 degrees (C). The solid is rapidly decomposed<br>
by water to form sulfuric acid.</p>

<p>SO3 is prepared by a contact process, ie by the action of oxygen
on<br>
sulfur dioxide in the presence of catalysts such as platinized
asbestos,<br>
platinized magnesium sulfate, ferric oxide, or vanadium compounds.
It<br>
may be prepared in the lab by heating fuming sulfuric acid and<br>
collecting the sublimate in a cooled receiver. Depending on the<br>
conditions of condensation (temperature and pressure) there are
three<br>
different forms, alpha, beta and gamma with different melting
points and<br>
vapour pressures.</p>

<p>It is an intermediate in sulfuric acid manufacture.</p>

<p>&gt; &gt; Although sulfuric acid tends to pull water from the

<p>Rather than insulting the poster, Charles, you could have pointed
out<br>
that the gas most likely released from sulfuric acid is SO2, sulfur<br>
dioxide, which does react with water to produce sulfurous acid
(H2SO3),<br>
which reacts with organic materials and could damage a rope. However,<br>
given the possibly hot conditions in a car, you could also release
SO3<br>
which would rapidly recombine with any water to form sulfuric
acid.</p>

<p>&gt; &gt; This S03 gas can diffuse through your nylon bag into
the core of your rope where it could be absorbed by water in the
damp rope.</p>

<p>&gt; Truly your understanding of this process is magical. That
is, it doesn't exist.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you do not understand the process either,
Charles.<br>

<p>David, you have an extremely creative imagination, but this

<p>I don't know where to begin criticizing your claim that a rope's<br>
sheath is not "that much security relevant". The sheath
is woven<br>
tighter than the core and (as mentioned above) wears more rapidly
than<br>
the core. This means that the core will likely be in OK shape
even if<br>
the sheath has been damaged, however both components act together
to<br>
give the rope its energy absorption and strength.</p>

<p>&gt; Anyhow, your rope does not sound like much wear judging
from your<br>

<p>Did your rope come with care instruction? If not, have you

<p>Here's what Beal Ropes recommends:</p>

<p>Ropes should be washed periodically to help remove sharp particles<br>
from the sheath and so prevent them penetrating to the core where<br>
they can cut the fibres. Use a mild detergent (as might be used
for<br>
delicate fabrics) in cold water. Dry slowly, and store away from<br>
sources of heat and out if direct sunlight. This applies to the<br>
storage of all fibre products - store in a cool, dry place away<br>
from direct sunlight and all possible contaminants (if you're<br>
really keen, store in an inert environment like nitrogen ; )</p>

<p>[http://www.bealropes.com/english.dir/care.html]</p>

<p>They show a picture of a faucet and scrub brush. I put the
rope in a<br>
mesh bag and toss it in a front loading washing machine. Tossing
a<br>
loose rope in a washing machine will result in a gordian knot.</p>

<p>There are wash-in dry treatments you can use to increase water<br>
repellancy.</p>

Allright you wiseasses...if YOU don't know how to use them either<br>
then don't rag on Mr. Strock for actually asking a smart question.<p></p>

<p>Hank's comments below are great. I'd also add that if it came
on a <br>
spool, follow the manufacturer's specs on uncoiling it. Usually
you<br>
want to roll the entire length off rather than pulling it off
as the <br>
latter will introduce kinks. I just do that into a tub of water
and begin<br>
the soaking process. Flake out in the shade to dry, then bag the
line<br>
instead of coiling it.</p>

<p>It's also good to know that a static line will shrink after
getting<br>
wet (or with age) between 5% and 10% of its length. So that's
<br>
why I buy my stat lines much longer than the final size I want
them.<br>
But this is a little too late in your case...good luck.</p>

<p>&gt;Soak it overnight in water to remove lubricants used in

&gt;tighten the sheath. The rope will stiffen somewhat sooner
(i.e. before <br>

<p>I can back Ben up on this. Here the results of some testing

back. All these are on *static* rope, so the results may not necessarily<br>

carry *more* of the load than on static, not less (because the

Date - Wed Nov 10 16:23:52 1999<br>
  From: Tom Moyer &lt;tmoyer@xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;<br>
Newsgroups: rec.climbing<br>
<br>
I know this has been the subject of lots of flaming already, but
since I<br>
actually have some information (not that that's really a requirement
for<br>
posting on rec.climbing), here goes ...</p>

<p>I learned this weekend at the International Technical Rescue
Symposium<br>
that the figure eight version of the Euro Death Knot is being
actively<br>
taught to climbers in Canada. I had thought that only the overhand<br>
version was in widespread use and that everyone pretty much recognized<br>
the figure eight to have the potential to be a really quick trip
to the<br>
bottom of the crag.</p>

<p>For those who don't know what this knot is, check out the drawings
at<br>
http://www.petzl.com/FRENG/tech/techframe.html</p>

<p>Failure of the figure eight version of this knot has already
caused a<br>
fatality in1994 at Seneca Rocks and an accident in 1995 in Salt
Lake.</p>

<p>Both of these knots would politely be called "mis-loaded"
and impolitely<br>
would be called, well - the "Euro Death Knot". The failure
mode for the<br>
figure eight version is to flip/invert/capsize, which then becomes
the<br>
identical twin of the first knot, just with shorter tails. After
enough<br>
of these events there are no tails left and the knot fails. Leaving
at<br>
least a foot of tail is recommended.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours yesterday in my front yard with a come-a-long
and a<br>
load cell to try to get some decent information on this. The results<br>
still leave room for plenty of argument. People who don't like
the<br>
figure eight will say, "See, it slips at really low loads!"
People who<br>
do like it will say, "See, if you dress it right, pretension
it well,<br>
and leave long tails, it doesn't fail. Besides, I've been using
it for<br>
years and I'm still alive!"</p>

<p>If you're too impatient to wade through the results below,
the short<br>
answer is that if you do all those things, you should be ok. My
question<br>
is - why would you take the chance? If you're in a situation where
a<br>
stuck rope would be catastrophic, use the overhand. It has all
the same<br>
advantages and not nearly as much risk.</p>

<p>Ok - here's the next round of tests. Should add a little more
fuel to the<br>
fire...</p>

<p>Some comments:<br>
When the overhand inverts, it doesn't really do the same thing
as the 8 does.<br>
The 8 flips completely around and it's really obvious. It also
eats a huge<br>
chunk of the tails when it does. The overhand kind of twists a
little, some<br>
more rope goes through the knot, and the force goes down. Any
time I pulled on<br>
the come-a-long and the force went *down* a few hundred pounds
or more, I noted<br>
the peak force before it happened. I'm going to change my terms
and call it<br>
"rolled" to differentiate it from way the figure-eight
behaves.</p>

<p>As before, all rope breaks (with one exception noted below)
happened at the<br>
knot being tested.</p>

<p>Tests 18, 19, and 20 are on double fisherman's knots, pretty
much the gold<br>
standard for comparison. As before, the load is on a single strand,
with a<br>
figure eight on a bight at each end. For #19 and #20, the double
fisherman's is<br>
loose and mis-tied in every way I can think of that you could
still sort of<br>
call it a double fisherman's knot. Definitely the worst excuse
for a DFK I've<br>
ever seen.</p>

recommending the figure 8 version. The accepted practice now is
the overhand<br>
version, although some folks continue to use the figure 8 style.</p>

<p>It's pretty clear that both versions of the EDK suck if you
don't tie them<br>
cleanly and pretension them well.</p>

<p>Yep, your results confirm mine that I posted here several years
ago.<br>
There is NO advantage of the fig-8 version. Pity people don't
listen.<br>
Both the AMGA and CMGA are guilty on this. <br>

</font>Tom Moyer</b>,<b>Paul Tusting, Chris Harmston,<br>

</b>Many climbers carry an 18-foot length of accessory cord called
a cordelette for rigging anchors and as a tool for self-rescue
situations. In the past, this cord was usually 7mm Nylon. In recent
years, many climbers have changed to using one of a number of
high-strength materials in smaller diameters. Vectran, Technora,
Spectra, Kevlar, Kevlar/Spectra blends and Spectra/Nylon webbing
are all used for these purposes along with Nylon cord and Nylon
webbing. <b>(click <a href="{{ "/tech/High_Strength_Cord.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"  target="_blank">here</a>
