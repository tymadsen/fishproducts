**Subject: water-knot slip failures**\\
From: Tom Moyer &lt;tmoyer@xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Date: Wed, 24 Mar 1999 12:59:14 -0700

Hey all -

here's a report I just got around to writing on some water-knot
testing\\
I did a while ago. This testing was very interesting and takes
care of a\\
lot of concerns I had about strange and unconfirmable failures
of this\\
knot. I posted it to the MRA and SAR lists - thought others might
want\\
to have a look, too.

\- Tom Moyer

Summary\\
Anecdotal evidence exists to suggest that water knots - commonly
used to\\
join webbing into a sling - sometimes fail by slipping. I have
found\\
through testing on a load frame that this knot gradually slips
when\\
cycled repeatedly with loads as low as body weight. When the tails
have\\
slipped all the way into the knot, it fails. This resolves the
concern I\\
have had about "mysterious" failures of this knot. I
believe it is\\
completely safe to use as long as it is checked and found to have\\
sufficient tails before loading.

Background\\
I have been told many anecdotal stories of accidents caused by
the\\
failure of water knots (aka ring bends or overhand follow-through
knots)\\
by slipping. Understanding these failures is of some concern to
mountain\\
rescuers who use this as a standard knot for tying two ends of
a webbing\\
sling together. Many climbing and rescue texts recommend leaving
plenty\\
of tail with this knot and pretensioning it carefully to avoid
possible\\
slipping, but none of them provides any detail on failures. Past\\
pull-testing I have done on water knots (with sufficient tails)
showed\\
no slipping failures - no matter how poorly the knot was dressed
or how\\
poorly it was pretensioned. This caused me some consternation.
If a knot\\
occasionally has mysterious failures that I can't duplicate, should
we\\
be using that knot for rescue work? Suggestions by other climbers
(and\\
the temporary availability of a programmable load frame) prompted
me to\\
look at the possibility that these knots were slipping over time
under\\
repeated loading and unloading cycles, rather than by slipping
when\\
loaded for the first time.

Test Methods\\
I used a small MTS load frame to pull on a loop of 9/16"
tubular webbing\\
tied with a water knot. The load was cycled from 0 to 250 lbs
at a\\
fairly slow loading and unloading rate (about two seconds per
cycle).\\
Loads and extensions were measured directly by the load frame.
The test\\
was halted automatically upon failure of the knot.

Results\\
The test showed consistent slipping of one of the tails into the
knot at\\
an average rate of 0.0035 inches per cycle. A knot that started
with\\
tails almost three inches long failed in 806 cycles. It was interesting\\
to note that only one of the tails slipped into the knot - the
one on\\
the "top" side of the knot.

A second test with overhand safeties on the water knot gradually
slipped\\
through 1.75 inches of tail at about the same slip rate (0.0028
inches\\
per cycle), and then cinched and did not slip any further.

A loop tied with a water knot was loaded with a static pull
of 200 lbs\\
to check whether the knot was slipping by creeping. The test was
run for\\
thirteen minutes. During the first eight minutes, the loop elongated
by\\
0.025 inches. After that, it had no significant elongation. The
water\\
knot seems to be affected by loading and unloading, not by a static\\
pull.

A third cycle test was done on a loop tied with a single fisherman's\\
knot. Over the first 750 cycles, the loop elongated by 0.247 inches.\\
After that, no further elongation occurred. The test was discontinued
at\\
1630 cycles.

Conclusions\\
Water knots definitely fail by slipping under cyclic loading.
Low loads,\\
such as body weight, are sufficient to cause failure. Other knots
(such\\
as a single fisherman's) tied in the same material do not exhibit
this\\
kind of failure. Overhand safeties tied on top of a water knot
may\\
prevent the failure, but do not guarantee it.

This is not all bad news for water knots. I now understand
the mechanism\\
of failure and know how to prevent it. This is a lot more comforting\\
than using a knot about which I have suspicions. I will always
check the\\
length of the tails on every water knot - and particularly every
fixed\\
rappel anchor tied with a water knot - before trusting my life
to it. We\\
will continue to use water knots in Salt Lake County SAR, and
continue\\
to require long tails on this knot as we always have.

**Subject: test report, knots in spectra and nylon**\\
  From: matt.dimeo@xxxxxxxxxxxx\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Date: Thu, 08 Jul 1999 20:17:56 GMT

Chris Harmston at Black Diamond showed his typical generosity
and\\
pull-tested some samples for me, so I'm passing on the results\\
to add to the general knowledge base.

First some background: some months back there was a rec.climbing\\
discussion about Webolettes and their application. At the time,\\
I brought up the possibility of making your own out of spectra\\
cord with loops tied in the ends. This test was meant to check\\
the feasibility of that.

I figured that if I could tie a spectra-cord "webolette"
with strength\\
comparable to a 7mm nylon cordelette, I'd do so, preferring cord\\
to webbing for self-rescue reasons.

As it turns out (see results below), it's not even close. Nylon\\
cord is stronger than I had remembered, for one thing, and having\\
a single strand of cord cuts the strength nearly in half over
a loop.\\
I actually figured that out before I sent the samples off, but
after\\
I had already bought and cut the cord. This probably would have\\
been obvious to many of you.

I sent three samples each of the following configurations,
and\\
got these results:

Configuration #1: spectra cord loop, tied with triple fisherman's\\
(i.e. a normal cordellete)\\
Samples all broke @pin, at 3717, 3467, and 4034 lbf.

Configuration #2: 7mm Nylon cord loop tied with double fisherman's\\
(cordelette)\\
Samples all broke @pin, at 3286, 3605, and 3299 lbf.

Configuration #3: spectra cord with figure eights tied at each
end.\\
Backup knots were used, but made no difference (they didn't come\\
tight). This is the webolette configuration.\\
Samples all broke @knot, at 1779, 1793, 1884 lbf.

Configuration #4: As #3, but with a triple-fisherman loop in
each\\
end (see below).\\
Broke at knot, at 1745, 1725, 1709 lbf.

The knot tied in #4 was created by feeding a triple fisherman
knot\\
through itself. To tie it, start tying a 3-fish around a pencil,\\
then feed the short end back through along the pencil, pull out\\
the pencil, and tie the other half of the 3-fish. You end up with\\
a small loop.

Conclusions and observations:\\
1. nylon cordelletes didn't break much weaker than spectra, so
if\\
you use spectra cordelletes because you think they're stronger,
you\\
might be wasting your money.\\
2. The triple fisherman loop I sort-of invented didn't break any\\
stronger than the figure eights. Actually a little weaker.

all cord used was new. The spectra was 5.5mm blue water. The\\
nylon was 7mm, don't know the manufacturor. The test rig used
10mm\\
pins at 4"/minute.

Send email if you have any questions about the above.

Claimer and Disclaimer:\\
Any mistakes above are mine, not Chris's, and not Black Diamond's.\\
If you make safety decisions based on any of the above data, and\\
your head pops off as a result, it's your own damn fault.\\

**Subject: Biner Orientation for Sport Draws**\\
  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Date: Tue, 4 May 1999 09:45:53 -0600

I have to dissagree with the recommendations of having the
gates face the\\
same way or the opposite way, every situation is different and
may\\
require different techniques. I recommend setting up draws with
a\\
selection of different length of runners with the biners oriented
in the\\
same direction and the opposite direction. I only recommend fixing
the\\
bottom biner. Here are my reasons in order of importance (based
on\\
likelyhood of failure in my opinion):

Note, I think through these issues EVERY TIME I clip a piece
of pro on\\
every route. Learn to do this quickly. Assess every piece of pro
every\\
time. I do not believe that there is one technique that works
in every\\
situation.

1) Bottom biner must not be loaded over an edge or buldge.
Use different\\
length of draw if needed. If this is not possible then use a locking\\
biner. Look for rotational effects. The buldge or edge may not
be\\
located directly below the bolt but could be off to the side.
Make sure\\
you think about how the draw will move when you fall from different
places\\
on the route above you. Often times a route will force you to
climb both\\
to the right and to the left of the piece below you. Remember
this when\\
clipping your pro. Try to assess where you might be most likely
to fall\\
from and set up your pro accordingly.\\
2) Top biner must not be loaded over an edge or buldge. On bolted
sport\\
routes this does occur fairly often. Use a locking biner for these\\
situations, two biners, add a backup tie off, or better yet if
you think\\
you might fall on this bolt-BAIL. Then slap the first ascentionist\\
repeatedly until they fix their fuckup. Often times you can simply
rotate\\
the biner with the gate opening downwards to reduce the likelyhood
of the\\
buldge opening the gate. In general I try to make sure that the
gate\\
faces away from the bolt head. It can interfere with the biner
gate in\\
some rare situations. Top biners are much less likely to unclip
if they\\
are not fixed to the quickdraw, therefore I do not fix the top
biner to\\
the draw. \\
3) Bottom biner must not be back clipped. Unclip and reclip the
rope\\
until it is clipped correctly. \\
4) Bottom biner gate must face away from the direction you are
climbing\\
towards.\\
5) Orientation of either biner is independent of where you are
clipping\\
from. They are dependent on where you are going and the variables
above.\\
Be able to clip with either hand with the biners facing either
direction.\\
Setting up your draws and clipping them in one direction just
because you\\
have poor technique is a bad excuse that could have harsh consequences\\
given the right circumstances. Learn the pinch clip and the index
clip\\
and the palm clip and and and. Be proficient at any clip! There
are times\\
when this is not feasible. When climbing at your limit you may
need to\\
force a certain type of direction to make the clip easier. Be
aware that\\
this may not be the best situation when falling from above.\\
6) Carry 1 or two draws with locking biners on both ends for those\\
situations where you can't avoid biner interaction with buldges
or edges\\
or when faced with a hard crux or runout where gear failure would
be\\
disastrous.

These are my personal opinions from my own experiences in climbing
not\\
from testing that I have done.

**Webbing Loop Strength Q:**\\

&gt;Question. I have a piece of 9/16" tubular webbing that

&gt;Thanks..BOB

Good question. I had never tried this before. I went to the
lab and\\
performed this test. I used two runners, one with a overhand knot
in the\\
center and one in the normal configuration. These were 11 inches
long and\\
were 5/8" spectra. Both were new. I did not test nylon runners.

Loop Rating: 22 kN = 4946 lbf.

Loop strength: 26.6 kN = 5974 lbf.\\
Loop with overhand in center: 15 kN = 3367 lbf.

Nearly a 50% reduction in strength.

So, to answer Bob's question I would say that his runner would
break\\
somewhere around 7 kN. Now, this is assuming that he was asking
the\\
question about runners, not single strand webbing. To answer the
question\\
on single strand with a knot in one end he would have to be explicit\\
about the test setup. Chris

&gt; OK, so I'm stupid. I just realized that I've been using quickdraws

Yup. I see this all the time.

&gt; I'm gonna buy some 12" Blue Water sewn open\\
&gt; runners and girth hitch them to my cam slings.

There's a better way. \\
All my cams are set up with 5.5mm spectra/kevlar/whatever to form\\
an 8 to 10" loop. Position the knot (double or triple fishermans)\\
about 3/4ths of the way from the cam. Put a thin piece of tape
\\
about 1/2" from the stem to short-circuit the loop and form
an "8"\\
with a big loop and a small loop. Leave just enough room to be
\\
able to clip a biner between the tape and the stem in case you
\\
want to use it as a quickdraw in a pinch. The tape keeps the loop
\\
from shifting, the knot out of the way, and keeps things hanging\\
neatly on the rack. Eventually, the cord will take a "set"
which\\
you'll find beneficial.

Color-code the cord to match the color of the Mfg's sling.\\
This way, you'll still have a "Yellow Camalot" for your
less \\
retentive partners. Use soft cord.

I've found that the smaller the cam, the longer the sling should\\
be (at least for free climbing) because the smaller springs allow
\\
the cam to walk more easily. Smaller persons may find having cams
\\
bashing them in the knees to be a problem. Ignore their whining.

Now you can place a cam without having to put a draw on it.
You\\
can carry fewer draws. Your rack will be lighter. You can place,\\
clip and be moving sooner. You might start to consider dumping
\\
all those wired stoppers and replacing them with roped stoppers...

\- Lord Slime, those slings they come with are worthless.

Just for your information.\\
I just tested two sets of SEWN samples in our test lab.

Sample 1: 2- 5/8" Spectra Runners Girth hitched: Failed
at 3678 lbs,\\
at the Girth Hitch knot. This is 1492 lbs below our 3 Sigma rating
of 5170\\
lbs.

Sample 2: 2- 9/16" Nylon Runners Girth hitched: Failed
at 3191 lbs, at\\
the Girth Hitch knot. This is 630 lbs below our 3 Sigma rating
of 3821\\
lbs.

Note: these runners are new and do not reflect the strengths
of runners\\
which have been in use (they will be weaker!). One sample is not\\
statistically valid. You can expect that many samples would fail
below\\
this load I measured if we were to test many samples.

Warning: This test is not an indication that girth hitching
your runners\\
is "safe". Girth hitching is not recommended by Black
Diamond. If you\\
use this technique to extend your runner length then you are responsible\\
for it. Girth hitching is weaker than using biners to connect
the runners.

Showing my age. A rabbit runner was an old Forrest product

simply a sling with biner loops at both ends. Before Spectra webbing\\
came along, they didn't instill much confidence. For an anchor,
clip one\\
loop to each outside piece, bring the middle up to the center

Yep, this is all rather pedantic. But since you asked, it goes
back to\\
WWII (I don't have my reference materials handy so I've probably
got\\
this wrong). Dupont invented a synthetic polyamide type 6 molecule
chain\\

a\\
type 6,6 molecule chain (Perlon) which produced a fiber with higher\\
tensile strength.

&gt; And yes... There are good alternatives. Gemini works well
for\\

knottable\\

Slinging Camalot Jr's requires that the webbing be doubled

adequate\\
and will fail at loads well below the 12 kN rating.

This may have been in quick clips, but this is not recommended

following another letter to them regarding slinging Camalots.

April 21 1995

In reference to the Quick Clips (#151) by John MacDonald regarding
the\\
retrofitting of double stem Camalots with Camalot Jr. thumb loops
and\\
slings I am writing to state that this practice is not endorsed
by Black\\
Diamond Equipment. We feel that this situation described and depicted
in\\
Quick Clips is potentially dangerous.

1) Cutting the Nylatron Thumb Bar down to make room for the
Jr. Thumb\\
Loop may create two potential problems. First, if in cutting the\\
Nylatron Thumb Bar you are to damage the cable in any way, this
could\\
affect the strength of the Cam. Second, the Thumb Bar and trigger\\
assembly are designed to each other. Cutting the Thumb Bar short
may\\
cause the trigger to bottom out on the Thumb Bar and not enable
full\\
retraction of the cams.

2) Sewing slings on the Jr. Thumb Loop requires overlapped
webbing. A\\
single layer of webbing as depicted in the diagram is insufficient.
When\\
testing these situations we have found that the Thumb Loop will
break\\
near 1000 lbs. After that the webbing is in contact with the cable.
For\\
the single webbing situation the webbing is cut by the cable at
loads\\
between 1500 and 2000 lbs. These forces are relatively easy to
achieve\\
in normal climbing situations. Therefore, it will be possible
to see\\
sling failure and possible injury from this situation. Black Diamond
now\\
sews its Camalot Jr's. with runners that have a double layer of
webbing\\
around the cable and Thumb Bar. The Thumb Bar still breaks at
about 1000\\
lbs, but the runners do not break until near 3000 lbs. In fact,
about\\
half of the batch test samples fail at the cable and the other
half fails\\
at the runner. We do not recommend that you put runners on old
style\\
double stem Camalots. If you need a runner on you Camalot Jr.
then send\\
them to Black Diamond for a retrofit.

3) A doubled or girth hitched sling on either Camalot is also
not\\
recommended by Black Diamond. The reason for this is that the
runner\\
still has no protection from the cable. For the Camalot Jr. sling
the\\
inner webbing is not structural, it is there to protect the outer
webbing\\
which is the structural component. The sling is sewn in such a
manner to\\
prevent the structural outside webbing from ever contacting the
cable.\\
The inner webbing is sewn to the outer and this keeps them both
in place\\
(i.e., the inner against the cable and the outer away from it).

&gt; &gt;While I admit that I didn't know BD's official opinion
was this, it doesn't\\

tied sling is fine -\\
&gt; &gt;it's strong ENOUGH. The fact that it fails below the
12 kN rating proves\\
&gt; &gt;little. Your other gear will break long before the sling
does.

I don't think tied slings are fine in all situations. They
break well\\
below that of sewn slings, are prone to untying themselves, and
I know of\\
accidents involving them (untying and cutting on Camalot cables).
In\\
nearly every situation you will not generate enough force to cut
or break\\
webbing or hardware. If you have a high fall factor with nearly
static\\
belay (i.e. aid soloing is the most dangerous form of climbing
in my\\
opinion because the forces are higher--if you use static belays)
you\\
dramatically increase the possibility of failure.

&gt; No they're not. The reason that you haven't heard about
the cam\\
&gt; cutting webbing in the way that you describe I would attribute
to:\\
&gt; 1) Not that many tie webbing like you describe,\\
&gt; 2) Not that many take high factor falls.

I agree with these comments. The number one issue is that most
people do\\
not hear the details of accidents. I have investigated quite a
few gear\\
failure incidents. Gear does break during normal situations encountered\\
in climbing.

&gt; Now, 12kN isn't that much to begin with in the first place,
if you\\
&gt; double that, not exactly true due to friction but we have
to start\\
&gt; somewhere, you land at about a factor one fall. Catch that
with one of\\
&gt; the more static belay devices on the market and the little
red warning\\
&gt; lights are sure to go off.

&gt; &gt;Black Diamond uses the 3-Sigma system to determine
necessary breaking\\
&gt; &gt;strengths, and these strengths are far, far above what
is necessary\\
&gt; &gt;in the field.

Absolutely incorrect. Just because we give a rating does not
in any way\\
mean the product will not break. It is possible to break every
piece of\\
equipment we make if the conditions are just right. Our rating
system is\\
just that, a rating of where the gear fails when new and when
tested in\\
the lab. We make products that will not hold falls. Climbers use
these\\
to protect themselves routinely. So why do we do this? If we were
to use\\
the strict engineering safaty factor rating and guarantee that
you would\\
never break gear in any situation encountered in climbing then
you would\\
not be climbing. Camalot Jr's would be for 8 inch cracks and would
weigh\\
10 pounds. There would not be any Stoppers or Steel nuts. Carabiners\\
would be three times heavier and all would have autolocking sleeves.\\
And, you would all retire your ropes and gear after even the smallest\\
fall. So why do we sell gear we know has the potential to fail?
Because\\
we are climbers and we recognize the need for the protection we
sell.\\
Technique is what protects you foremost, not the gear. Placing
protection\\
often to reduce the fall factor, equalizing small nuts, using
low impact\\
ropes (carefull with these since they may stretch you into a ledge),
etc.

&gt; Whether BD use 3-sigma or slaughter a chicken at full
moon to decide\\
&gt; *breaking* strengths of their gear is of course totally irrelevant
to\\
&gt; the discussion of whether the chosen strength is sufficient
or not.

The chosen strength of "12 kN" is not enough. You
can generate more force\\
than this. It does not happen very often though. 12 kN is the
force\\
chosen by the UIAA and CEN to be the limit of force in the rope
during the\\
first drop of a factor 1.8 fall (and just happens to be the 3
sigma\\
strength of our Cam Jr's). This is not the force felt by the edge\\
they drop the weight over. REI has conducted drop tests and measured
the\\
forces at the climber, belayer, and protection. They found that
the force\\
on the protection is about 2/3 greater than that in the rope.
This means\\
that the protection can see forces approaching 20 kN. Use an old
fat rope\\
and you could generate even more force than this.

&gt; As anyone with a background in mech. eng. can tell you,
if you started\\
&gt; rating other gear used in safety critical applications with
the\\
&gt; max. expected breaking load, instead of the more common 3
times safety\\
&gt; margin to the yield stress of the material, you'd be out
of a job. So,\\
&gt; no, they are *not* "far, far above what is necessary
in the field."\\
&gt; Quite the opposite actually. Ask anyone involved in rescue
work.

Correct. Climbing gear is not engineered to never fail. It
is not\\
possible given the currently available materials and designs and
costs.\\
Technique is what protects you foremost. Blind faith in anything
is not\\
sound advice.

&gt; That BD does not unnecessarily and purposely wish to introduce
a weak\\
&gt; point in their design by recommending that you tie a sling
the way you\\
&gt; have advocated in my mind reflects very favorably on them.
Especially\\
&gt; since the design impact is neglible in terms of cost, weight
etc.\\
&gt;

Single loops cut on the wire of the Jr's. These loads range
from 1500 to\\
2500 lbs. With the doubled loop the cable breaks at loads over
3000 lbs\\
(rating is 12 kN = 2698 lbf.). We feel that the use of single\\
loops is not sound advice. They are still strong enough for the
vast\\
majority of situations you could encounter. End BD recommendations.

The following recommendation is my personal one and is not
to be taken as\\
recommendations by Black Diamond. I use single loops. I recognize
the\\
limitations of doing this. I know that these can fail at much
lower\\
loads. I never use these as the only piece of pro when there is
the\\
potential for a high fall factor. I use double loops so that the
webbing\\
can be extended. I also cover the wire with a 1/4" thick
layer of\\
fiberglass tape and athletic tape to help protect the web from
the cable.\\
Using tied slings is fine for many situations. I don't use them
if I have\\
a choice.

Irrelevant FYI.\\
I have been climbing since 1981. I have onsighted 12- trad and
12+ sport.\\
I lead WI6 and have put up about 2 dozen first ascents on rock
and ice. I\\
have no wall experience other than long free routes done in a
day. Not\\
that this is pertinent to the discussion, but I am a climber.
Safety of\\
gear is my hobby. Testing climbing gear is my job. I have BS degrees
in\\
Physics and Materials Engineering. I have a masters degree in
Materials\\
Engineering and quit my PhD program with 18 months to go so that
I could\\
work for BD. I have been with BD for 5 years.

**Physics of Screamers by YATES**\\
Author: John Yates/ Pro Design USA\\
  Email: &nbsp; prodesig@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\
Date: 1998/12/08\\
Forums: rec.climbing

Hello all,

I friend of mine rang me up this morning and told me about
a discussion\\
going on in this news group about forces involved with screamers
and air\\
voyagers &lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;\\
My name is John Yates, and I have done extensive work with various
load\\
limiting ìStitch Rippingî devices since the invention
of the Screamerís\\
almost ten years ago. I thought I could shed some light on this
subject\\
for those interested.\\
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;

Dan (Osman) and I had many lengthy discussions on how to limit
the loads on his\\
rope jump systems. We talked about the use of a Tyrolians, Screamers
to\\
limit loads and use of High Strength Tie-off Pulleys to terminate
the\\
rope ends. It is hard to believe that forces could be generated
that\\
would ìBRAKEî a climbing rope if Dan had the system
set up as usual. Dan\\
usually had Screamers set in the system in a tandem configuration
(ie.\\
two side by side). This configuration would limit the load and
the\\
Screamers would elongate if forces over 950-1000 lbf. were reached\\
during a jump. If the system was configured right there was a
ìWEEK\\
LINKî ie. Screamers that would activate if forces reached
any thing\\
close to a critical level. I hope the investigation will reveal
how Dan\\
had his system set up, only then can we really speculate on what
really\\
happened.

Anyway about Screamers.\\
Screamers are a stitch ripping device that allows forces to be\\
decelerated over a longer time interval than they would be if
the\\
Screamers were not in the system. Standard Screamers or ICE-Screams
are\\
configures from stitch patterns consisting of 6 rows of zigzag
stitching\\
sewn into each wing of the unit. This stitching is done by means
of a\\
computerized sewing machine. The machine can be configured to
allow the\\
Screamer to activate basically anywhere between 1 and 650 lbf.
We chose\\
to use an average activation of 550 lbf. because it seamed to
be about\\
the right force to use as a upper limit for marginal protection
and Ice\\
screws. Not every thing is a real science.

Some interesting things happen when you look at how much energy
is\\
ìabsorbedî in the system when a screamer is used.
If the ìTrueî\\
absorption is measured in a completely static system, lets say
doing a\\
drop test with a steel cable and weight we will see that about
5-600 lbf\\
was absorbed by the stitch ripper(Screamer). When a Screamer though
is\\
put in a system which uses dynamic climbing rope instead of static
steel\\
cable the amount of energy which is absorbed is increase by 25-40%.
We\\
see that the absorption of energy increases to 800-900 lbf. I
can\\
attribute this extra energy we see being absorbed to the fact
that the\\
ìDynamicî climbing rope in the system is allowed
to elongate and remain\\
dynamic for a longer time interval than it would be, if there
was no\\
screamer in the system.

An example: A dynamometer or load cell is placed on a bolt
hanger. A\\
climber takes a fall which generates a fall with a factor of .5.
This\\
generates a force of 2000lbf as seen on the dynamometer. When
a\\
Screamer is hooked in the system below the dyno. the same fall
only\\
shows a peak force of 1200 lbf. We know from extensive testing
that the\\
Screamer can only absorb 500 lbf. So how do we account for the
extra 300\\
lbf seen in this example???\\
The increased time interval(duration) of the fall allowed the
climbing\\
rope to be more absorptive!!\\
Thus Screamers limit loads and dissipate energy over a an increased
time\\
interval. This increase in the duration of the fall is most important\\
in a ìDynamicî systems because it allows the rope
to do its job even\\
better than it was designed to do.

Stitch ripping devices have been used in many other areas besides
just\\
climbing. Many industrial application have been developed for
the use of\\
Stitch ripping devices. The most common is the Fall Arrest lanyard\\
which uses a woven type of screamer device to decelerate a industrial\\
worker if he falls in the workplace.

Over the last ten years I have worked on numerous projects
with various\\
Aerospace companies such as McDonnel Douglas and Bowing to develop\\
various types of Stitch Ripper ìScreamerî type devices.
They use them\\
to decelerate objects which seperate from one another during controlled\\
testing. The coolest project I worked on was a rocket fairing
which was\\
to house a communications satellite during launch on a Titan rocket.
The\\
fairing separation test was conducted in a vacuum chamber which
took\\
about 120 rippers in an elaborate configuration to decelerate
the\\
various parts of the fairing after the explosive bolts separated
them.\\
Anyway the point is that climbers are not the only ones using
this type\\
of technology to their benefit.

If any of the other physics nerds in this group would like
to discuss\\
specifics on the use of Screamers in various climbing applications,
I\\
would be more than happy to respond.

**Strength of knotted runners**

  From: ratagonia@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Subject: Tied Supertape Runner Strength Test\\
Date: Fri, 19 Mar 1999 23:29:01 GMT

Another test from the Black Diamond test lab. Since we tested
tacked\\
supertape and tacked spectra runners girth hitched together, and
found them\\
to be 70% as strong as a single tacked runner, I was curious as
to how strong\\
a tied Supertape runner is. So I took the same spool of 11/16"
nylon\\
Supertape and tied up some runners using a well-dressed water
knot.

3-19-99 TD 14787\\
Results: ( all values in lbf )

3798, 4067, 4423, 4585, 3988. All broke where the web enters
the knot.\\
AVG = 4172\\
sigma(n-1) = 323\\
Rating = 2911 ( Rating is AVG less 3.9*sigma(n-1) )

Compare to the Tacked runners in the same material ( TD 14742):\\
AVG = 5713\\
sigma(n-1) = 156\\
Rating = 5105

Results: 1. Tied Nylon Runners tested on average 73% of the
strength of a\\
sewn runner in the same material. 2. Variance in a tied runner
is pretty\\
high. The rating of the tied runner is only 57% of the rating
of the tacked\\
runner.

Conclusions: 1.You lose a lot when using a tied runner. About
the same loss\\
as when girth hitching them together to make them longer. 2.The
tied runner\\
variance is pretty high. The knot 'system' is not a consistent
system.

My Personal Opinions:\\
1.Tied runners are probably all right most of the time. After
all, we've been\\
using them for years and we don't see many break in the field,
do we?\\
2.I would be careful about tying runners out of low-strength materials
like\\
9/16" supertape. Yeah, we thought they were strong. But they
are not that\\
strong.

**Runner Girth Hitch Data from BD**

  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing\\
Subject: Runner Girth Hitch Data from BD\\
Date: Tue, 16 Mar 1999 17:28:36 -0700

As a followup to requests and slams from several rec.climbers
Tom Jones\\
(ratagonia) has prepared some samples and I have had them tested.
Here\\
are some results that will appear on Karl Lew's web page (I hope?).

All samples are BD product. All samples are pulled between
10 mm steel\\
pins at 4 inches per minute. Numbers expressed below are pounds
force\\
(lbf) unless otherwise stated. "Location" is the location
where failure\\
occurred. Stdev is the standard deviation (n-1).

I use mixed metric and english units. Sorry if you can't convert
in your\\
head. I have converted the important ones for those who care.
This\\
statement is added due to the New Zealand rec.snowclimber who
slammed me a\\
month ago for not using metric units. Sorry, we live in a dual
system so\\
deal with it.

****************************************************************\\
Control Groups (this is what we sell, for those who care):

Question: Are BD slings weaker than our competitors? What do
ratings on\\
products really mean? Why are BD runners rated at 22 kN (the minimum
CEN\\
requirement)?

Answer: Some competitors slings are stronger and some are not.
Ratings\\
are primarily marketing related. Stronger is supposed to be better,\\
right?. Basically, we have multiple types of runners that all
pass CEN.\\
Different lots of material have different strengths. Different
sewing\\
machine setups have different results. All this combines into
a runner\\
program that requires frequent rating changes and multiple tags
that need \\
to be inventoried and controlled. When we change a rating we have
to\\
recertify it through our CEN certification body ($800 per product
cert).\\
Rating all runners at 22 kN regardless of whether they are really
stronger\\
is significantly cheaper than the lost sales due to the marketing\\
advantages of a higher rating. Irrelevant rambling on my part,
sorry.

Conclusions:\\
1) These are variable systems. Multiple data points are needed
in order\\
to be able to state real trends between groups. Don't base your\\
conclusions on single data points. This is my reservation of Karl's
web\\
page. He paid for the samples so I can't fault him too much. I
keep\\
asking him to give me more samples because I really love to break
stuff!\\
2) 11/16" Nylon Sewn Runners are 93% of the strength of 5/8"
Spectra\\
Sewn Runners on average.\\
3) Girth Hitching reduces the strength of the material by 30%
on average.\\
4) Girth Hitching strength is more or less independent of what
it is\\
attached to (at least for this test). Note the similar strengths
between\\
Nylon hitched to Nylon or Spectra and Spectra hitched to Spectra
or Nylon.\\
5) If you must link two runners a carabiner (krab for the Euro's)
is\\
stronger. If you must use a girth hitch then girth hitch onto
the weaker\\
material. In other words, make sure that the runner that has the
knot is\\
the stronger one. \\
6) Karl has some new fangled knots that are stronger. See his
web page. \\
7) Quite a long post for such a minor topic. Wasted two hours
of my time\\
today. I hope it was worth it. I will probably have to make this
time\\
up. chris

Those of you who have been following the Girth Hitch saga\\
will be surprised to learn the latest development. The\\
linked girth hitch knot I show at www.best.com/~klew/knot.shtml\\
is actually *WORSE* than a girth hitch. The two samples\\
I sent Chris failed at 49%-56% of tested/rated strength,\\
depending on material (spectra/nylon and spectra/spectra).\\
Egad. Danger, Will Robinson!

Once again, many thanks to Chris and his staff at Black Diamond\\

Can you guys spew, or what!

OK, enough philosophy, let me dig into the BD runner test files
and see what I\\
can find.

9-16-98 Single Strand Test: Blue 11/16" supertape sample:

3418, 3396, 3385 avg = 3399 lbf == 15.2 kN

9-15-98 Loop &amp; Dogbone tests, same webbing, cut 15",
5 tacks, 138 thread:

Loops: 9 samples, avg = 5810 lbf == 25.9 kN s.d. = 139 lbf\\
Dogbones: 10 samples, avg = 5822 lbf == 26.0 kN s.d. = 138 lbf

Lost strength = (2*15.2)-26 = 4.4 kN == 14.5% in this example.

**Runner strength TEST REPORT 2**

  From: ratagonia@xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\
Newsgroups: rec.climbing

Again, searching the BD runner test files, I think you all
might be rather\\
put out by how large the variation in strength is in a simple
item like a\\
brand new sewn sling. We have collected a lot of data over the
years, but\\
let me just summarize one item:

5/8" spectra/nylon runners ( 3 lengths ). This raw material
specs did not\\
change in this time period, though several different batches of
webbing were\\
probably involved. The tacks and thread probably did not change,
and break\\
point is usually at the pin. The test method probably did not
change.

The data from batch tests is summarized on a graph. For each
batch test of\\
3-10 runners, the high, low and mean are charted. Data from about
80 batches\\
are shown.

I look at the data ( on a graph ) for values from 5/9/96 to
7/7/97. I see a\\
range of values from a low of 5100 lbf to a high of 6900 lbf (
22.8 kN to 30.8\\
kN ). The bulk of values are in the range of 5500 lbf to 6500
lbf.

While most batch tests have a range of about 800 lbs, a very
few have as wide\\
a range as 1500 lbs. Each batch is made with the same webbing,
tack pattern,\\
thread, humidity, operator, clamp, machine and probably needle.

So the "strength of a sling" is not that fixed of
a value. We rate these\\
slings at 22 kN. And over the course of 14 months, we saw a strength
range of\\
22.8 to 30.8 kN in individual pieces that we tested ( a range
of 30% of the\\
total strength ). And there's the strength rating of the webbing...
but\\
that's another topic.

HEY - these are my own, personal opinions and conclusions,
and are not those\\
of my employer.

Correct, probably around 25kN if normal biners are used and
assuming the\\
stitching doesn't blow (big assumption if you sew it yourself).
For\\
static breaking strength, the webbing (or rope) runs around very
large\\
capstans (1 ft. diameter or bigger) so it has little real world
value.

The web-o-lette is designed for a two-piece anchor. The cordalette's\\
usual length is intended for a three-piece anchor. The web-o-lette
is 10\\
feet. After tying the fisherman's, the cordalette is usually 16
to 18\\
feet. 10/2 = (roughly) 16/3. Even at 18 feet, with six strands,
there's\\
only a six-inch difference at most.

As a sport anchor the web-o-lette is ideal and the cordalette
is overkill.\\
As a trad anchor, the web-o-lette usually needs to be supplemented
(of\\
course, sometimes the cordalette does too).

Is that fear-calming enough?

**Real World Loop Strength**

On Fri, 8 Jan 1999, Russ Walling wrote to Chris Harmston :

&gt;Hi Chris,\\
&gt;Had a few questions I was hoping you could help me with.\\
&gt;Q: Say a cable or webbing is rated to X. Is there a quick
and easy\\
&gt;convert to find loop strength, assuming the bond is full strength?
How\\
&gt;about real world loop strength, as loaded between biners,
not just\\
&gt;math?

Most people would assume that the strength of a loop is twice
the strength\\
of the single strand breaking strength. What I have found is that
this is\\
not correct for two reasons. First is that the tack does factor
in. It\\
is not always easy to ensure that the tack is stronger than the
webbing.\\
So take off 5%. Second is that the single strand strength is obtained
by\\
testing over large radii. Loops are tested over 10 mm pins. The
pins\\
weaken the loop as you should expect. So remove another 5%. What
I find\\
is that the loop strength is about 10% weaker than 2 times the
single\\
strand rating. This is plus or minus 5% or there abouts.

&gt;Q: same Q as above, but instead of a loop, a rabbit runner
config, ie:\\
&gt;loop at each end, single strand in the center. Load applied
in each\\
&gt;loop.

Here the tack does not factor in as much. Only the effect of
the pins.\\
So take of 5%. This is pure assumption because I have not looked
at this\\
data myself (even though we had rabbit ears in the bivy and Big
Wall I\\
tent-we use loops now).

I forgot to answer the carabiner runner question. Basically
the biners\\
are like a 10 mm pin. Sometimes the radius of the biner is too
curved and\\
then the runner breaks even lower. Also, wide runners put greater
load on\\
the carabiner gate side and biners are found to break significantly
below\\
ratings when tested with wide runners.
