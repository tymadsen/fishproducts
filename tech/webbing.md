</font>Subject: water-knot slip failures</b><br>
From: Tom Moyer &lt;tmoyer@xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;<br>
Newsgroups: rec.climbing<br>
Date: Wed, 24 Mar 1999 12:59:14 -0700<p></p>

<p>Hey all -</p>

<p>here's a report I just got around to writing on some water-knot
testing<br>
I did a while ago. This testing was very interesting and takes
care of a<br>
lot of concerns I had about strange and unconfirmable failures
of this<br>
knot. I posted it to the MRA and SAR lists - thought others might
want<br>
to have a look, too.</p>

<p>- Tom Moyer</p>

<p>Summary<br>
Anecdotal evidence exists to suggest that water knots - commonly
used to<br>
join webbing into a sling - sometimes fail by slipping. I have
found<br>
through testing on a load frame that this knot gradually slips
when<br>
cycled repeatedly with loads as low as body weight. When the tails
have<br>
slipped all the way into the knot, it fails. This resolves the
concern I<br>
have had about "mysterious" failures of this knot. I
believe it is<br>
completely safe to use as long as it is checked and found to have<br>
sufficient tails before loading.</p>

<p>Background<br>
I have been told many anecdotal stories of accidents caused by
the<br>
failure of water knots (aka ring bends or overhand follow-through
knots)<br>
by slipping. Understanding these failures is of some concern to
mountain<br>
rescuers who use this as a standard knot for tying two ends of
a webbing<br>
sling together. Many climbing and rescue texts recommend leaving
plenty<br>
of tail with this knot and pretensioning it carefully to avoid
possible<br>
slipping, but none of them provides any detail on failures. Past<br>
pull-testing I have done on water knots (with sufficient tails)
showed<br>
no slipping failures - no matter how poorly the knot was dressed
or how<br>
poorly it was pretensioned. This caused me some consternation.
If a knot<br>
occasionally has mysterious failures that I can't duplicate, should
we<br>
be using that knot for rescue work? Suggestions by other climbers
(and<br>
the temporary availability of a programmable load frame) prompted
me to<br>
look at the possibility that these knots were slipping over time
under<br>
repeated loading and unloading cycles, rather than by slipping
when<br>
loaded for the first time.</p>

<p>Test Methods<br>
I used a small MTS load frame to pull on a loop of 9/16"
tubular webbing<br>
tied with a water knot. The load was cycled from 0 to 250 lbs
at a<br>
fairly slow loading and unloading rate (about two seconds per
cycle).<br>
Loads and extensions were measured directly by the load frame.
The test<br>
was halted automatically upon failure of the knot.</p>

<p>Results<br>
The test showed consistent slipping of one of the tails into the
knot at<br>
an average rate of 0.0035 inches per cycle. A knot that started
with<br>
tails almost three inches long failed in 806 cycles. It was interesting<br>
to note that only one of the tails slipped into the knot - the
one on<br>
the "top" side of the knot.</p>

<p>A second test with overhand safeties on the water knot gradually
slipped<br>
through 1.75 inches of tail at about the same slip rate (0.0028
inches<br>
per cycle), and then cinched and did not slip any further.</p>

<p>A loop tied with a water knot was loaded with a static pull
of 200 lbs<br>
to check whether the knot was slipping by creeping. The test was
run for<br>
thirteen minutes. During the first eight minutes, the loop elongated
by<br>
0.025 inches. After that, it had no significant elongation. The
water<br>
knot seems to be affected by loading and unloading, not by a static<br>
pull.</p>

<p>A third cycle test was done on a loop tied with a single fisherman's<br>
knot. Over the first 750 cycles, the loop elongated by 0.247 inches.<br>
After that, no further elongation occurred. The test was discontinued
at<br>
1630 cycles.</p>

<p>Conclusions<br>
Water knots definitely fail by slipping under cyclic loading.
Low loads,<br>
such as body weight, are sufficient to cause failure. Other knots
(such<br>
as a single fisherman's) tied in the same material do not exhibit
this<br>
kind of failure. Overhand safeties tied on top of a water knot
may<br>
prevent the failure, but do not guarantee it.</p>

<p>This is not all bad news for water knots. I now understand
the mechanism<br>
of failure and know how to prevent it. This is a lot more comforting<br>
than using a knot about which I have suspicions. I will always
check the<br>
length of the tails on every water knot - and particularly every
fixed<br>
rappel anchor tied with a water knot - before trusting my life
to it. We<br>
will continue to use water knots in Salt Lake County SAR, and
continue<br>
to require long tails on this knot as we always have.</p>

<p><b>Subject: test report, knots in spectra and nylon</b><br>
  From: matt.dimeo@xxxxxxxxxxxx<br>
Newsgroups: rec.climbing<br>
Date: Thu, 08 Jul 1999 20:17:56 GMT</p>

<p>Chris Harmston at Black Diamond showed his typical generosity
and<br>
pull-tested some samples for me, so I'm passing on the results<br>
to add to the general knowledge base.</p>

<p>First some background: some months back there was a rec.climbing<br>
discussion about Webolettes and their application. At the time,<br>
I brought up the possibility of making your own out of spectra<br>
cord with loops tied in the ends. This test was meant to check<br>
the feasibility of that.</p>

<p>I figured that if I could tie a spectra-cord "webolette"
with strength<br>
comparable to a 7mm nylon cordelette, I'd do so, preferring cord<br>
to webbing for self-rescue reasons.</p>

<p>As it turns out (see results below), it's not even close. Nylon<br>
cord is stronger than I had remembered, for one thing, and having<br>
a single strand of cord cuts the strength nearly in half over
a loop.<br>
I actually figured that out before I sent the samples off, but
after<br>
I had already bought and cut the cord. This probably would have<br>
been obvious to many of you.</p>

<p>I sent three samples each of the following configurations,
and<br>
got these results:</p>

<p>Configuration #1: spectra cord loop, tied with triple fisherman's<br>
(i.e. a normal cordellete)<br>
Samples all broke @pin, at 3717, 3467, and 4034 lbf.</p>

<p>Configuration #2: 7mm Nylon cord loop tied with double fisherman's<br>
(cordelette)<br>
Samples all broke @pin, at 3286, 3605, and 3299 lbf.</p>

<p>Configuration #3: spectra cord with figure eights tied at each
end.<br>
Backup knots were used, but made no difference (they didn't come<br>
tight). This is the webolette configuration.<br>
Samples all broke @knot, at 1779, 1793, 1884 lbf.</p>

<p>Configuration #4: As #3, but with a triple-fisherman loop in
each<br>
end (see below).<br>
Broke at knot, at 1745, 1725, 1709 lbf.</p>

<p>The knot tied in #4 was created by feeding a triple fisherman
knot<br>
through itself. To tie it, start tying a 3-fish around a pencil,<br>
then feed the short end back through along the pencil, pull out<br>
the pencil, and tie the other half of the 3-fish. You end up with<br>
a small loop.</p>

<p>Conclusions and observations:<br>
1. nylon cordelletes didn't break much weaker than spectra, so
if<br>
you use spectra cordelletes because you think they're stronger,
you<br>
might be wasting your money.<br>
2. The triple fisherman loop I sort-of invented didn't break any<br>
stronger than the figure eights. Actually a little weaker.</p>

<p>all cord used was new. The spectra was 5.5mm blue water. The<br>
nylon was 7mm, don't know the manufacturor. The test rig used
10mm<br>
pins at 4"/minute.</p>

<p>Send email if you have any questions about the above.</p>

your head pops off as a result, it's your own damn fault.<br>

<p><b>Subject: Biner Orientation for Sport Draws</b><br>
  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxxxx&gt;<br>
Newsgroups: rec.climbing<br>
Date: Tue, 4 May 1999 09:45:53 -0600</p>

<p>I have to dissagree with the recommendations of having the
gates face the<br>
same way or the opposite way, every situation is different and
may<br>
require different techniques. I recommend setting up draws with
a<br>
selection of different length of runners with the biners oriented
in the<br>
same direction and the opposite direction. I only recommend fixing
the<br>
bottom biner. Here are my reasons in order of importance (based
on<br>
likelyhood of failure in my opinion):</p>

<p>Note, I think through these issues EVERY TIME I clip a piece
of pro on<br>
every route. Learn to do this quickly. Assess every piece of pro
every<br>
time. I do not believe that there is one technique that works
in every<br>
situation.</p>

<p>1) Bottom biner must not be loaded over an edge or buldge.
Use different<br>
length of draw if needed. If this is not possible then use a locking<br>
biner. Look for rotational effects. The buldge or edge may not
be<br>
located directly below the bolt but could be off to the side.
Make sure<br>
you think about how the draw will move when you fall from different
places<br>
on the route above you. Often times a route will force you to
climb both<br>
to the right and to the left of the piece below you. Remember
this when<br>
clipping your pro. Try to assess where you might be most likely
to fall<br>
from and set up your pro accordingly.<br>
2) Top biner must not be loaded over an edge or buldge. On bolted
sport<br>
routes this does occur fairly often. Use a locking biner for these<br>
situations, two biners, add a backup tie off, or better yet if
you think<br>
you might fall on this bolt-BAIL. Then slap the first ascentionist<br>
repeatedly until they fix their fuckup. Often times you can simply
rotate<br>
the biner with the gate opening downwards to reduce the likelyhood
of the<br>
buldge opening the gate. In general I try to make sure that the
gate<br>
faces away from the bolt head. It can interfere with the biner
gate in<br>
some rare situations. Top biners are much less likely to unclip
if they<br>
are not fixed to the quickdraw, therefore I do not fix the top
biner to<br>
the draw. <br>
3) Bottom biner must not be back clipped. Unclip and reclip the
rope<br>
until it is clipped correctly. <br>
4) Bottom biner gate must face away from the direction you are
climbing<br>
towards.<br>
5) Orientation of either biner is independent of where you are
clipping<br>
from. They are dependent on where you are going and the variables
above.<br>
Be able to clip with either hand with the biners facing either
direction.<br>
Setting up your draws and clipping them in one direction just
because you<br>
have poor technique is a bad excuse that could have harsh consequences<br>
given the right circumstances. Learn the pinch clip and the index
clip<br>
and the palm clip and and and. Be proficient at any clip! There
are times<br>
when this is not feasible. When climbing at your limit you may
need to<br>
force a certain type of direction to make the clip easier. Be
aware that<br>
this may not be the best situation when falling from above.<br>
6) Carry 1 or two draws with locking biners on both ends for those<br>
situations where you can't avoid biner interaction with buldges
or edges<br>
or when faced with a hard crux or runout where gear failure would
be<br>
disastrous.</p>

<p>These are my personal opinions from my own experiences in climbing
not<br>
from testing that I have done.</p>

&gt;Question. I have a piece of 9/16" tubular webbing that

&gt;just created? At what approximate point would it fail?<br>
&gt;Thanks..BOB</p>

<p>Good question. I had never tried this before. I went to the
lab and<br>
performed this test. I used two runners, one with a overhand knot
in the<br>
center and one in the normal configuration. These were 11 inches
long and<br>
were 5/8" spectra. Both were new. I did not test nylon runners.</p>

<p>Loop Rating: 22 kN = 4946 lbf.</p>

<p>Loop strength: 26.6 kN = 5974 lbf.<br>
Loop with overhand in center: 15 kN = 3367 lbf.</p>

<p>Nearly a 50% reduction in strength.</p>

<p>So, to answer Bob's question I would say that his runner would
break<br>
somewhere around 7 kN. Now, this is assuming that he was asking
the<br>
question about runners, not single strand webbing. To answer the
question<br>
on single strand with a knot in one end he would have to be explicit<br>
about the test setup. Chris</p>

&gt; OK, so I'm stupid. I just realized that I've been using quickdraws

<p>Yup. I see this all the time.<br>
<br>
&gt; I'm gonna buy some 12" Blue Water sewn open<br>
&gt; runners and girth hitch them to my cam slings.</p>

<p>There's a better way. <br>
All my cams are set up with 5.5mm spectra/kevlar/whatever to form<br>
an 8 to 10" loop. Position the knot (double or triple fishermans)<br>
about 3/4ths of the way from the cam. Put a thin piece of tape
<br>
about 1/2" from the stem to short-circuit the loop and form
an "8"<br>
with a big loop and a small loop. Leave just enough room to be
<br>
able to clip a biner between the tape and the stem in case you
<br>
want to use it as a quickdraw in a pinch. The tape keeps the loop
<br>
from shifting, the knot out of the way, and keeps things hanging<br>
neatly on the rack. Eventually, the cord will take a "set"
which<br>
you'll find beneficial.</p>

<p>Color-code the cord to match the color of the Mfg's sling.<br>
This way, you'll still have a "Yellow Camalot" for your
less <br>
retentive partners. Use soft cord.</p>

<p>I've found that the smaller the cam, the longer the sling should<br>
be (at least for free climbing) because the smaller springs allow
<br>
the cam to walk more easily. Smaller persons may find having cams
<br>
bashing them in the knees to be a problem. Ignore their whining.</p>

<p>Now you can place a cam without having to put a draw on it.
You<br>
can carry fewer draws. Your rack will be lighter. You can place,<br>
clip and be moving sooner. You might start to consider dumping
<br>
all those wired stoppers and replacing them with roped stoppers...</p>

<p>- Lord Slime, those slings they come with are worthless.</p>

<p>Just for your information.<br>
I just tested two sets of SEWN samples in our test lab.</p>

<p>Sample 1: 2- 5/8" Spectra Runners Girth hitched: Failed
at 3678 lbs,<br>
at the Girth Hitch knot. This is 1492 lbs below our 3 Sigma rating
of 5170<br>
lbs.</p>

<p>Sample 2: 2- 9/16" Nylon Runners Girth hitched: Failed
at 3191 lbs, at<br>
the Girth Hitch knot. This is 630 lbs below our 3 Sigma rating
of 3821<br>
lbs.</p>

<p>Note: these runners are new and do not reflect the strengths
of runners<br>
which have been in use (they will be weaker!). One sample is not<br>
statistically valid. You can expect that many samples would fail
below<br>
this load I measured if we were to test many samples.</p>

<p>Warning: This test is not an indication that girth hitching
your runners<br>
is "safe". Girth hitching is not recommended by Black
Diamond. If you<br>
use this technique to extend your runner length then you are responsible<br>
for it. Girth hitching is weaker than using biners to connect
the runners.</p>

<p>Showing my age. A rabbit runner was an old Forrest product
that was<br>
simply a sling with biner loops at both ends. Before Spectra webbing<br>
came along, they didn't instill much confidence. For an anchor,
clip one<br>
loop to each outside piece, bring the middle up to the center
piece<br>
(there are now four strands), tie an overhand. I'm sure Chris
"ASCII<br>
artist" Weaver can illustrate this for you.</p>

<p>Yep, this is all rather pedantic. But since you asked, it goes
back to<br>
WWII (I don't have my reference materials handy so I've probably
got<br>
this wrong). Dupont invented a synthetic polyamide type 6 molecule
chain<br>
called Nylon that changed the world. The Germans(?) later developed
a<br>
type 6,6 molecule chain (Perlon) which produced a fiber with higher<br>
tensile strength.</p>

<p>&gt; And yes... There are good alternatives. Gemini works well
for<br>
&gt; slinging hexes, but too stiff for cordalettes. Vectran is
knottable<br>
&gt; and good for all-around use. I am considering switching to
Vectran<br>
&gt; for my cordalette when I retire the Spectra.</p>

<p>I like Web-o-lettes from Mountain Gear (a long rabbit runner)
since they<br>
aren't as bulky.<br>

&gt; For old style camalots you can cut about 1/4" off each
side of the black plasic<br>
&gt; and then fit a camalot Jr thumb piece and then sling. This
only works on 1 and<br>
&gt; 2's. This was in a quick clip in climbing some time this
past spring.</p>

<p>This may have been in quick clips, but this is not recommended
by Black<br>
Diamond in any way. The following is a letter I sent to Climbing
magazine<br>
following another letter to them regarding slinging Camalots.</p>

<p>April 21 1995</p>

<p>In reference to the Quick Clips (#151) by John MacDonald regarding
the<br>
retrofitting of double stem Camalots with Camalot Jr. thumb loops
and<br>
slings I am writing to state that this practice is not endorsed
by Black<br>
Diamond Equipment. We feel that this situation described and depicted
in<br>
Quick Clips is potentially dangerous.</p>

<p>1) Cutting the Nylatron Thumb Bar down to make room for the
Jr. Thumb<br>
Loop may create two potential problems. First, if in cutting the<br>
Nylatron Thumb Bar you are to damage the cable in any way, this
could<br>
affect the strength of the Cam. Second, the Thumb Bar and trigger<br>
assembly are designed to each other. Cutting the Thumb Bar short
may<br>
cause the trigger to bottom out on the Thumb Bar and not enable
full<br>
retraction of the cams.</p>

<p>2) Sewing slings on the Jr. Thumb Loop requires overlapped
webbing. A<br>
single layer of webbing as depicted in the diagram is insufficient.
When<br>
testing these situations we have found that the Thumb Loop will
break<br>
near 1000 lbs. After that the webbing is in contact with the cable.
For<br>
the single webbing situation the webbing is cut by the cable at
loads<br>
between 1500 and 2000 lbs. These forces are relatively easy to
achieve<br>
in normal climbing situations. Therefore, it will be possible
to see<br>
sling failure and possible injury from this situation. Black Diamond
now<br>
sews its Camalot Jr's. with runners that have a double layer of
webbing<br>
around the cable and Thumb Bar. The Thumb Bar still breaks at
about 1000<br>
lbs, but the runners do not break until near 3000 lbs. In fact,
about<br>
half of the batch test samples fail at the cable and the other
half fails<br>
at the runner. We do not recommend that you put runners on old
style<br>
double stem Camalots. If you need a runner on you Camalot Jr.
then send<br>
them to Black Diamond for a retrofit.</p>

<p>3) A doubled or girth hitched sling on either Camalot is also
not<br>
recommended by Black Diamond. The reason for this is that the
runner<br>
still has no protection from the cable. For the Camalot Jr. sling
the<br>
inner webbing is not structural, it is there to protect the outer
webbing<br>
which is the structural component. The sling is sewn in such a
manner to<br>
prevent the structural outside webbing from ever contacting the
cable.<br>
The inner webbing is sewn to the outer and this keeps them both
in place<br>
(i.e., the inner against the cable and the outer away from it).</p>

&gt; &gt;While I admit that I didn't know BD's official opinion
was this, it doesn't<br>
&gt; &gt;address the point I was making. The point is that the
tied sling is fine -<br>
&gt; &gt;it's strong ENOUGH. The fact that it fails below the
12 kN rating proves<br>
&gt; &gt;little. Your other gear will break long before the sling
does.</p>

<p>I don't think tied slings are fine in all situations. They
break well<br>
below that of sewn slings, are prone to untying themselves, and
I know of<br>
accidents involving them (untying and cutting on Camalot cables).
In<br>
nearly every situation you will not generate enough force to cut
or break<br>
webbing or hardware. If you have a high fall factor with nearly
static<br>
belay (i.e. aid soloing is the most dangerous form of climbing
in my<br>
opinion because the forces are higher--if you use static belays)
you<br>
dramatically increase the possibility of failure.</p>

<p>&gt; No they're not. The reason that you haven't heard about
the cam<br>
&gt; cutting webbing in the way that you describe I would attribute
to:<br>
&gt; 1) Not that many tie webbing like you describe,<br>
&gt; 2) Not that many take high factor falls.</p>

<p>I agree with these comments. The number one issue is that most
people do<br>
not hear the details of accidents. I have investigated quite a
few gear<br>
failure incidents. Gear does break during normal situations encountered<br>
in climbing.</p>

<p>&gt; Now, 12kN isn't that much to begin with in the first place,
if you<br>
&gt; double that, not exactly true due to friction but we have
to start<br>
&gt; somewhere, you land at about a factor one fall. Catch that
with one of<br>
&gt; the more static belay devices on the market and the little
red warning<br>
&gt; lights are sure to go off.</p>

<p>&gt; &gt;Black Diamond uses the 3-Sigma system to determine
necessary breaking<br>
&gt; &gt;strengths, and these strengths are far, far above what
is necessary<br>
&gt; &gt;in the field.</p>

<p>Absolutely incorrect. Just because we give a rating does not
in any way<br>
mean the product will not break. It is possible to break every
piece of<br>
equipment we make if the conditions are just right. Our rating
system is<br>
just that, a rating of where the gear fails when new and when
tested in<br>
the lab. We make products that will not hold falls. Climbers use
these<br>
to protect themselves routinely. So why do we do this? If we were
to use<br>
the strict engineering safaty factor rating and guarantee that
you would<br>
never break gear in any situation encountered in climbing then
you would<br>
not be climbing. Camalot Jr's would be for 8 inch cracks and would
weigh<br>
10 pounds. There would not be any Stoppers or Steel nuts. Carabiners<br>
would be three times heavier and all would have autolocking sleeves.<br>
And, you would all retire your ropes and gear after even the smallest<br>
fall. So why do we sell gear we know has the potential to fail?
Because<br>
we are climbers and we recognize the need for the protection we
sell.<br>
Technique is what protects you foremost, not the gear. Placing
protection<br>
often to reduce the fall factor, equalizing small nuts, using
low impact<br>
ropes (carefull with these since they may stretch you into a ledge),
etc.</p>

<p>&gt; Whether BD use 3-sigma or slaughter a chicken at full
moon to decide<br>
&gt; *breaking* strengths of their gear is of course totally irrelevant
to<br>
&gt; the discussion of whether the chosen strength is sufficient
or not.</p>

<p>The chosen strength of "12 kN" is not enough. You
can generate more force<br>
than this. It does not happen very often though. 12 kN is the
force<br>
chosen by the UIAA and CEN to be the limit of force in the rope
during the<br>
first drop of a factor 1.8 fall (and just happens to be the 3
sigma<br>
strength of our Cam Jr's). This is not the force felt by the edge<br>
they drop the weight over. REI has conducted drop tests and measured
the<br>
forces at the climber, belayer, and protection. They found that
the force<br>
on the protection is about 2/3 greater than that in the rope.
This means<br>
that the protection can see forces approaching 20 kN. Use an old
fat rope<br>
and you could generate even more force than this.</p>

<p>&gt; As anyone with a background in mech. eng. can tell you,
if you started<br>
&gt; rating other gear used in safety critical applications with
the<br>
&gt; max. expected breaking load, instead of the more common 3
times safety<br>
&gt; margin to the yield stress of the material, you'd be out
of a job. So,<br>
&gt; no, they are *not* "far, far above what is necessary
in the field."<br>
&gt; Quite the opposite actually. Ask anyone involved in rescue
work.</p>

<p>Correct. Climbing gear is not engineered to never fail. It
is not<br>
possible given the currently available materials and designs and
costs.<br>
Technique is what protects you foremost. Blind faith in anything
is not<br>
sound advice.</p>

<p>&gt; That BD does not unnecessarily and purposely wish to introduce
a weak<br>
&gt; point in their design by recommending that you tie a sling
the way you<br>
&gt; have advocated in my mind reflects very favorably on them.
Especially<br>
&gt; since the design impact is neglible in terms of cost, weight
etc.<br>
&gt;</p>

<p>Single loops cut on the wire of the Jr's. These loads range
from 1500 to<br>
2500 lbs. With the doubled loop the cable breaks at loads over
3000 lbs<br>
(rating is 12 kN = 2698 lbf.). We feel that the use of single<br>
loops is not sound advice. They are still strong enough for the
vast<br>
majority of situations you could encounter. End BD recommendations.</p>

<p>The following recommendation is my personal one and is not
to be taken as<br>
recommendations by Black Diamond. I use single loops. I recognize
the<br>
limitations of doing this. I know that these can fail at much
lower<br>
loads. I never use these as the only piece of pro when there is
the<br>
potential for a high fall factor. I use double loops so that the
webbing<br>
can be extended. I also cover the wire with a 1/4" thick
layer of<br>
fiberglass tape and athletic tape to help protect the web from
the cable.<br>
Using tied slings is fine for many situations. I don't use them
if I have<br>
a choice.</p>

<p>Irrelevant FYI.<br>
I have been climbing since 1981. I have onsighted 12- trad and
12+ sport.<br>
I lead WI6 and have put up about 2 dozen first ascents on rock
and ice. I<br>
have no wall experience other than long free routes done in a
day. Not<br>
that this is pertinent to the discussion, but I am a climber.
Safety of<br>
gear is my hobby. Testing climbing gear is my job. I have BS degrees
in<br>
Physics and Materials Engineering. I have a masters degree in
Materials<br>
Engineering and quit my PhD program with 18 months to go so that
I could<br>
work for BD. I have been with BD for 5 years.</p>

Forums: rec.climbing</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>

<p>I friend of mine rang me up this morning and told me about
a discussion<br>
going on in this news group about forces involved with screamers
and air<br>
voyagers &lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;<br>
My name is John Yates, and I have done extensive work with various
load<br>
limiting ìStitch Rippingî devices since the invention
of the Screamerís<br>
almost ten years ago. I thought I could shed some light on this
subject<br>
for those interested.<br>
&lt;&lt;snip&gt;&gt;</p>

<p>Dan (Osman) and I had many lengthy discussions on how to limit
the loads on his<br>
rope jump systems. We talked about the use of a Tyrolians, Screamers
to<br>
limit loads and use of High Strength Tie-off Pulleys to terminate
the<br>
rope ends. It is hard to believe that forces could be generated
that<br>
would ìBRAKEî a climbing rope if Dan had the system
set up as usual. Dan<br>
usually had Screamers set in the system in a tandem configuration
(ie.<br>
two side by side). This configuration would limit the load and
the<br>
Screamers would elongate if forces over 950-1000 lbf. were reached<br>
during a jump. If the system was configured right there was a
ìWEEK<br>
LINKî ie. Screamers that would activate if forces reached
any thing<br>
close to a critical level. I hope the investigation will reveal
how Dan<br>
had his system set up, only then can we really speculate on what
really<br>
happened.</p>

<p>Anyway about Screamers.<br>
Screamers are a stitch ripping device that allows forces to be<br>
decelerated over a longer time interval than they would be if
the<br>
Screamers were not in the system. Standard Screamers or ICE-Screams
are<br>
configures from stitch patterns consisting of 6 rows of zigzag
stitching<br>
sewn into each wing of the unit. This stitching is done by means
of a<br>
computerized sewing machine. The machine can be configured to
allow the<br>
Screamer to activate basically anywhere between 1 and 650 lbf.
We chose<br>
to use an average activation of 550 lbf. because it seamed to
be about<br>
the right force to use as a upper limit for marginal protection
and Ice<br>
screws. Not every thing is a real science.</p>

<p>Some interesting things happen when you look at how much energy
is<br>
ìabsorbedî in the system when a screamer is used.
If the ìTrueî<br>
absorption is measured in a completely static system, lets say
doing a<br>
drop test with a steel cable and weight we will see that about
5-600 lbf<br>
was absorbed by the stitch ripper(Screamer). When a Screamer though
is<br>
put in a system which uses dynamic climbing rope instead of static
steel<br>
cable the amount of energy which is absorbed is increase by 25-40%.
We<br>
see that the absorption of energy increases to 800-900 lbf. I
can<br>
attribute this extra energy we see being absorbed to the fact
that the<br>
ìDynamicî climbing rope in the system is allowed
to elongate and remain<br>
dynamic for a longer time interval than it would be, if there
was no<br>
screamer in the system.</p>

<p>An example: A dynamometer or load cell is placed on a bolt
hanger. A<br>
climber takes a fall which generates a fall with a factor of .5.
This<br>
generates a force of 2000lbf as seen on the dynamometer. When
a<br>
Screamer is hooked in the system below the dyno. the same fall
only<br>
shows a peak force of 1200 lbf. We know from extensive testing
that the<br>
Screamer can only absorb 500 lbf. So how do we account for the
extra 300<br>
lbf seen in this example???<br>
The increased time interval(duration) of the fall allowed the
climbing<br>
rope to be more absorptive!!<br>
Thus Screamers limit loads and dissipate energy over a an increased
time<br>
interval. This increase in the duration of the fall is most important<br>
in a ìDynamicî systems because it allows the rope
to do its job even<br>
better than it was designed to do.</p>

<p>Stitch ripping devices have been used in many other areas besides
just<br>
climbing. Many industrial application have been developed for
the use of<br>
Stitch ripping devices. The most common is the Fall Arrest lanyard<br>
which uses a woven type of screamer device to decelerate a industrial<br>
worker if he falls in the workplace.</p>

<p>Over the last ten years I have worked on numerous projects
with various<br>
Aerospace companies such as McDonnel Douglas and Bowing to develop<br>
various types of Stitch Ripper ìScreamerî type devices.
They use them<br>
to decelerate objects which seperate from one another during controlled<br>
testing. The coolest project I worked on was a rocket fairing
which was<br>
to house a communications satellite during launch on a Titan rocket.
The<br>
fairing separation test was conducted in a vacuum chamber which
took<br>
about 120 rippers in an elaborate configuration to decelerate
the<br>
various parts of the fairing after the explosive bolts separated
them.<br>
Anyway the point is that climbers are not the only ones using
this type<br>
of technology to their benefit.</p>

Subject: Tied Supertape Runner Strength Test<br>
Date: Fri, 19 Mar 1999 23:29:01 GMT</p>

<p>Another test from the Black Diamond test lab. Since we tested
tacked<br>
supertape and tacked spectra runners girth hitched together, and
found them<br>
to be 70% as strong as a single tacked runner, I was curious as
to how strong<br>
a tied Supertape runner is. So I took the same spool of 11/16"
nylon<br>
Supertape and tied up some runners using a well-dressed water
knot.</p>

<p>3-19-99 TD 14787<br>
Results: ( all values in lbf )</p>

<p>3798, 4067, 4423, 4585, 3988. All broke where the web enters
the knot.<br>
AVG = 4172<br>
sigma(n-1) = 323<br>
Rating = 2911 ( Rating is AVG less 3.9*sigma(n-1) )</p>

<p>Compare to the Tacked runners in the same material ( TD 14742):<br>
AVG = 5713<br>
sigma(n-1) = 156<br>
Rating = 5105</p>

<p>Results: 1. Tied Nylon Runners tested on average 73% of the
strength of a<br>
sewn runner in the same material. 2. Variance in a tied runner
is pretty<br>
high. The rating of the tied runner is only 57% of the rating
of the tacked<br>
runner.</p>

<p>Conclusions: 1.You lose a lot when using a tied runner. About
the same loss<br>
as when girth hitching them together to make them longer. 2.The
tied runner<br>
variance is pretty high. The knot 'system' is not a consistent
system.</p>

<p>My Personal Opinions:<br>
1.Tied runners are probably all right most of the time. After
all, we've been<br>
using them for years and we don't see many break in the field,
do we?<br>
2.I would be careful about tying runners out of low-strength materials
like<br>
9/16" supertape. Yeah, we thought they were strong. But they
are not that<br>
strong.</p>

  From: Chris Harmston &lt;chrish@xxxxxxxxxxx&gt;<br>
Newsgroups: rec.climbing<br>
Subject: Runner Girth Hitch Data from BD<br>
Date: Tue, 16 Mar 1999 17:28:36 -0700</p>

<p>As a followup to requests and slams from several rec.climbers
Tom Jones<br>
(ratagonia) has prepared some samples and I have had them tested.
Here<br>
are some results that will appear on Karl Lew's web page (I hope?).</p>

<p>All samples are BD product. All samples are pulled between
10 mm steel<br>
pins at 4 inches per minute. Numbers expressed below are pounds
force<br>
(lbf) unless otherwise stated. "Location" is the location
where failure<br>
occurred. Stdev is the standard deviation (n-1).</p>

<p>I use mixed metric and english units. Sorry if you can't convert
in your<br>
head. I have converted the important ones for those who care.
This<br>
statement is added due to the New Zealand rec.snowclimber who
slammed me a<br>
month ago for not using metric units. Sorry, we live in a dual
system so<br>
deal with it.</p>

<p>****************************************************************<br>
Control Groups (this is what we sell, for those who care):</p>

<p>11/16" Nylon Supertape sewn loops (BD rating 22 kN = 4946
lbf).<br>

<p>Question: Are BD slings weaker than our competitors? What do
ratings on<br>
products really mean? Why are BD runners rated at 22 kN (the minimum
CEN<br>
requirement)?</p>

<p>Answer: Some competitors slings are stronger and some are not.
Ratings<br>
are primarily marketing related. Stronger is supposed to be better,<br>
right?. Basically, we have multiple types of runners that all
pass CEN.<br>
Different lots of material have different strengths. Different
sewing<br>
machine setups have different results. All this combines into
a runner<br>
program that requires frequent rating changes and multiple tags
that need <br>
to be inventoried and controlled. When we change a rating we have
to<br>
recertify it through our CEN certification body ($800 per product
cert).<br>
Rating all runners at 22 kN regardless of whether they are really
stronger<br>
is significantly cheaper than the lost sales due to the marketing<br>
advantages of a higher rating. Irrelevant rambling on my part,
sorry.</p>

<p>Conclusions:<br>
1) These are variable systems. Multiple data points are needed
in order<br>
to be able to state real trends between groups. Don't base your<br>
conclusions on single data points. This is my reservation of Karl's
web<br>
page. He paid for the samples so I can't fault him too much. I
keep<br>
asking him to give me more samples because I really love to break
stuff!<br>
2) 11/16" Nylon Sewn Runners are 93% of the strength of 5/8"
Spectra<br>
Sewn Runners on average.<br>
3) Girth Hitching reduces the strength of the material by 30%
on average.<br>
4) Girth Hitching strength is more or less independent of what
it is<br>
attached to (at least for this test). Note the similar strengths
between<br>
Nylon hitched to Nylon or Spectra and Spectra hitched to Spectra
or Nylon.<br>
5) If you must link two runners a carabiner (krab for the Euro's)
is<br>
stronger. If you must use a girth hitch then girth hitch onto
the weaker<br>
material. In other words, make sure that the runner that has the
knot is<br>
the stronger one. <br>
6) Karl has some new fangled knots that are stronger. See his
web page. <br>
7) Quite a long post for such a minor topic. Wasted two hours
of my time<br>
today. I hope it was worth it. I will probably have to make this
time<br>
up. chris</p>

<p>Those of you who have been following the Girth Hitch saga<br>
will be surprised to learn the latest development. The<br>
linked girth hitch knot I show at www.best.com/~klew/knot.shtml<br>
is actually *WORSE* than a girth hitch. The two samples<br>
I sent Chris failed at 49%-56% of tested/rated strength,<br>
depending on material (spectra/nylon and spectra/spectra).<br>
Egad. Danger, Will Robinson!</p>

<p>Once again, many thanks to Chris and his staff at Black Diamond<br>

<p>OK, enough philosophy, let me dig into the BD runner test files

<p>9-16-98 Single Strand Test: Blue 11/16" supertape sample:</p>

<p>3418, 3396, 3385 avg = 3399 lbf == 15.2 kN</p>

<p>9-15-98 Loop &amp; Dogbone tests, same webbing, cut 15",
5 tacks, 138 thread:</p>

<p>Loops: 9 samples, avg = 5810 lbf == 25.9 kN s.d. = 139 lbf<br>
Dogbones: 10 samples, avg = 5822 lbf == 26.0 kN s.d. = 138 lbf</p>

<p>Lost strength = (2*15.2)-26 = 4.4 kN == 14.5% in this example.</p>

<p>Again, searching the BD runner test files, I think you all
might be rather<br>
put out by how large the variation in strength is in a simple
item like a<br>
brand new sewn sling. We have collected a lot of data over the
years, but<br>
let me just summarize one item:</p>

<p>5/8" spectra/nylon runners ( 3 lengths ). This raw material
specs did not<br>
change in this time period, though several different batches of
webbing were<br>
probably involved. The tacks and thread probably did not change,
and break<br>
point is usually at the pin. The test method probably did not
change.</p>

<p>The data from batch tests is summarized on a graph. For each
batch test of<br>
3-10 runners, the high, low and mean are charted. Data from about
80 batches<br>
are shown.</p>

<p>I look at the data ( on a graph ) for values from 5/9/96 to
7/7/97. I see a<br>
range of values from a low of 5100 lbf to a high of 6900 lbf (
22.8 kN to 30.8<br>
kN ). The bulk of values are in the range of 5500 lbf to 6500
lbf.</p>

<p>While most batch tests have a range of about 800 lbs, a very
few have as wide<br>
a range as 1500 lbs. Each batch is made with the same webbing,
tack pattern,<br>
thread, humidity, operator, clamp, machine and probably needle.</p>

<p>So the "strength of a sling" is not that fixed of
a value. We rate these<br>
slings at 22 kN. And over the course of 14 months, we saw a strength
range of<br>
22.8 to 30.8 kN in individual pieces that we tested ( a range
of 30% of the<br>
total strength ). And there's the strength rating of the webbing...
but<br>
that's another topic.</p>

<p>HEY - these are my own, personal opinions and conclusions,
and are not those<br>
of my employer.</p>

<p>Correct, probably around 25kN if normal biners are used and
assuming the<br>
stitching doesn't blow (big assumption if you sew it yourself).
For<br>
static breaking strength, the webbing (or rope) runs around very
large<br>
capstans (1 ft. diameter or bigger) so it has little real world

only a six-inch difference at most.</p>

<p>As a sport anchor the web-o-lette is ideal and the cordalette

As a trad anchor, the web-o-lette usually needs to be supplemented

<p>On Fri, 8 Jan 1999, Russ Walling wrote to Chris Harmston :</p>

<p>&gt;Hi Chris,<br>
&gt;Had a few questions I was hoping you could help me with.<br>
&gt;Q: Say a cable or webbing is rated to X. Is there a quick
and easy<br>
&gt;convert to find loop strength, assuming the bond is full strength?
How<br>
&gt;about real world loop strength, as loaded between biners,
not just<br>
&gt;math?</p>

<p>Most people would assume that the strength of a loop is twice
the strength<br>
of the single strand breaking strength. What I have found is that
this is<br>
not correct for two reasons. First is that the tack does factor
in. It<br>
is not always easy to ensure that the tack is stronger than the
webbing.<br>
So take off 5%. Second is that the single strand strength is obtained
by<br>
testing over large radii. Loops are tested over 10 mm pins. The
pins<br>
weaken the loop as you should expect. So remove another 5%. What
I find<br>
is that the loop strength is about 10% weaker than 2 times the
single<br>
strand rating. This is plus or minus 5% or there abouts.</p>

<p>&gt;Q: same Q as above, but instead of a loop, a rabbit runner
config, ie:<br>
&gt;loop at each end, single strand in the center. Load applied
in each<br>
&gt;loop.</p>

<p>Here the tack does not factor in as much. Only the effect of
the pins.<br>
So take of 5%. This is pure assumption because I have not looked
at this<br>
data myself (even though we had rabbit ears in the bivy and Big
Wall I<br>
tent-we use loops now).</p>

<p>I forgot to answer the carabiner runner question. Basically
the biners<br>
are like a 10 mm pin. Sometimes the radius of the biner is too
curved and<br>
then the runner breaks even lower. Also, wide runners put greater
load on<br>
the carabiner gate side and biners are found to break significantly
below<br>
ratings when tested with wide runners.</p>
