            <b>"Why are all the steps on your aiders on the same side?"</b>
            <br>After trying all the alternatives, this set up has proven itself to be more efficient. It seemed that the orientation of the steps was too haphazard when the steps were on alternating sides. With all the steps on the same side, an easy walk-up was easier to achieve.</font>
    </center>
    <p><b><font size="+1">"What keeps the steps open and how well does 
            it work?"</font></b>
        <font size="+1">
            <br>We put tubular webbing into the steps and then add numerous rows of stitching to stiffen the steps. Our steps are not so stiff that they will catch on nubbins when pulling them up from the lower pieces, yet stay open and flexible while in use. Unlike the urethane inserts some manufacturers use, ours will not ever kink permanently or wear through and poke out the side of your aiders after one wall.</font>
    </p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">"Should I get grab loops on my aiders?"</font></b>
        <font size="+1">
            <br>Personal preference. I don't use them because they tend to make me lean awkwardly outward when trying to get up and into the aiders. I prefer to just grab the aiders either by the biner or directly behind the top loops and use my arm as a lever to launch into the steps. It feels to me more rigid and less wobbly than using the grab loops.</font>
    </p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">"How many pairs of aiders do I need?"</font></b>
        <font size="+1">
            <br>Two pairs is the standard. Using 3 single aiders has its fans, but two sets of two is the way to go. Fast, efficient, and easy to manage.</font>
    </p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">"Should I get them the same colors, or mixed 
            colors?"</font></b>
        <font size="+1">
            <br>Two colors might make things easier, but it is not really that big of a deal. Usually you are standing in one pair and the other pair is obvious.</font>
    </p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">"Should I get Alpine Aiders or your regular 
            Smart Aiders?"<br>
            </font></b>
        <font size="+1">Depends. The Alpine aiders are made from 3/4" webbing instead of the 1" webbing on our Smart Aiders. The pros are they are lighter and will bundle up easily into a biner when you are not using them. The cons are they "might" hurt your arch if you are doing a really long wall or have super soft shoes. I have not found this to be the case, but this is what I've been told. I personally use the Alpine Aiders and have had no problems.</font>

    <p><b><font size="+1">"Pros and Cons on your new Ladder Aiders?"</font></b>
        <font size="+1">
            <br>Pros: Always open, easy to advance up the steps, convenient handle at the top to pull on, lightweight.
            <br>Cons: Bulky, the handle that keeps them open can be a PITA in a tight corner,</font>
