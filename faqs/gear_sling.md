**"Can I use your Double Gear Sling as a chest harness?"**

Not recommended. I have used it like this once in hundreds of pitches. I was horizontal under a roof and reaching for a blind placement and it did help to keep my upper body from bending over backwards. One time in 20 years on 10 feet of one pitch. If you are a chest harness guy, you should buy a real chest harness/racking sling.


**"How strong are the racking loops?"**

Very. The outer one is runner strength and the inner loop should go to about 2500lbs.


**"How comfy is the Double Gear Sling?"**

Compared to regular gear slings, ultra comfy. Racks of 40 lbs are not uncommon on big walls and having the Double Gear Sling will make this no big deal.


**"I'm a big guy. Is it going to fit me?"**

There is loads of adjustment available. Smaller people might have a fit that is a bit big on them, but that should not affect comfort.


**"Can I use the Double Gear Sling for freeclimbing also?"**

Sure. This is becoming more and more common.
