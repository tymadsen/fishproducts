                <b>"Can I use your Double Gear Sling as a chest harness?"</b>
                <br>Not recommended. I have used it like this once in hundreds of pitches. I was horizontal under a roof and reaching for a blind placement and it did help to keep my upper body from bending over backwards. One time in 20 years on 10 feet of one pitch. If you are a chest harness guy, you should buy a real chest harness/racking sling.</font>

    <p><b><font size="+1">"How strong are the racking loops?"</font></b>
        <font size="+1">
            <br>Very. The outer one is runner strength and the inner loop should go to about 2500lbs.</font>
    </p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">"How comfy is the Double Gear Sling?"</font></b>
        <font size="+1">
            <br>Compared to regular gear slings, ultra comfy. Racks of 40 lbs are not uncommon on big walls and having the Double Gear Sling will make this no big deal.</font>
    </p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">"I'm a big guy. Is it going to fit me?"</font></b>
        <font size="+1">
            <br>There is loads of adjustment available. Smaller people might have a fit that is a bit big on them, but that should not affect comfort.</font>
    </p>
    <p><b><font size="+1">"Can I use the Double Gear Sling for freeclimbing 
            also?"</font></b>
        <font size="+1">
            <br>Sure. This is becoming more and more common.</font>
