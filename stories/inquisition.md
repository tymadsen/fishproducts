Here is a giant (150mb??, 10 minutes?) time waster. Yeah, I spelled
it wrong in the link, but this is The Inquisition out at Josh.
Me and Will re-birthing. Usual caveats: Quicktime 7, hopefully
broadband, blah blah blah.<br>

singer from Loverboy.... save it would ya?</p>

<p>Author: Jerry Dodrill<br>
Nice Russ! When do we get to see the second episode?</p>

<p>Author: Russ Walling<br>
Jerry... there has been a second episode with the Illustrious
JayBro and some other combatants. All attempts at the summit
have thus far been repelled. More will surely follow and meet
the same fate.</p>

<p>Author: Elcapinyoazz<br>
I burned the one Jaybro attempt I caught on video to disc this
morning. We can maybe mix that into the movie. (here it is: <a href="{{ "/movies/jaybro_wide.mov" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">{{ "/movies/jaybro_wide.mov" | prepend: site.baseurl }}</a>
)<br>
Here's a couple of stills of Jaybro and me getting bouted (some
folks like me have dial-up):</p>

<p></p><center>Jaybro a couple moves into it...<br>

<p></p><center>Then you get a bad jam...<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/WillInquisition.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="500" height="375" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"></center><p></p>

<p></p><center>And kick in one foot, then contort and cram the other
foot in, if you're a student (me)...<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/WillInquisition2.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="450" height="600" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"></center><p></p>

<p></p><center>Or both feet at once if you're the pro (aka the Jaybro)...<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/JaybroInquisition3.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="450" height="600" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"></center><p></p>

<p></p><center>Either way, you end up like this...<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/WillInquisition3.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="450" height="600" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"></center><p></p>

<p></p><center><img src="{{ "/pics/JaybroInquisition.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="450" height="600" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
And then? Good luck.</center><p></p>

<i>Munge asks, "Is that a head dab?"<br>
</i>Nah. That rock is actually behind him at that point, does
kinda look like that. There are some nice ripping out onto the
bean shots in the video though. And this guy is prominently featured
in the vid:</p>

Hey<br>
That thing is awesome. F'ckin awesome. It should be the finish
to outer limits. I wanna do it.<br>
The gemstone finish .......</p>

<p>Author: steelmnkey<br>
Thanks dude. My best angle. I got points deducted for using tape,
but I got them back by going shorts...</p>

Hey Susan,<br>
I'm glad to see the Inquisition didn't turn out to be too trivial.
I didn't get any photos when I was working on this thing so it's
nice to see these.<br>
Since you asked, I did get the problem on my return a day or
two later. To be fair though, I did tape my hand that I was doing
the majority of the jamming with, in which case the problem was
barely 5.8.<br>
Russ, got any video of Big Bob's Big Wedge? That one seemed a
little harder than the Inquisition</p>

<p>Author: Ed Hartouni<br>
first off, I don't do speedos, the LA zoo would be out to pick
me up and take me back to the ape cage....<br>
...second I don't do barefoot, I'd probably tape my feet....<br>
and lastly, those guys are all bad ass...<br>
Like I said to Gary weekend before last when he asked me if I
was shopping for a partner who could lead 5.11, "Gary, you
know it's not about the numbers, it's about how much skin you
can loose"<br>
BRAVO! Russ, Will, Jaybro, Steel... and all you JTree monkeys.</p>

<p>Author: Jaybro<br>
All in perspective, sometimes you have to take time out, smell
the roses,<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/DSCN0791.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="640" height="480" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
and psyche for the next attempt.</p>

Mussy,<br>
No Cubs hat? You look like a pale cholo at a Loverboy show with
that bandana!<br>
Did you and the crew give "Maneater" a go?<br>
VLG</p>

<p>Author: susan peplow<br>
Nobody's surprised about working the offwidth but how about Mussy
getting a haircut?<br>

Russ has white hair?<br>
I figured somebody dumped their chalkbag on his head.<br>
Susan, it's the cane hanging there in the picture that got me
wondering...</p>

<p>Author: Russ Walling<br>
That cane is the same one from the cover shot of Geriatric Ascensionist,
in use on my way to the Mace..... where is that pic anyway???<br>
found the pic edit.... made famous by the SteelMonkey:</p>

a minute."<br>
