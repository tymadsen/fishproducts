<p></p><center>Really quick and really bad TR.... we went to New
Jack City for the day. The usual crew, me, Will and Sooze. There
may be a 50/50 ratio of broken glass to sand at the base of the
routes, but this place is kinda ok.... So we do a warm-up....<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/1st.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="375" height="500" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
Then we do another one, which seemed more like a warm-out....
I was already gassed...<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/2nd.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="468" height="600" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
</center><p></p>

<p></p><center>The wind is whipping pretty good so we decide to eat
sandwiches in the car, which thank God is close by... I think
we might of had some beer too..... Then we make the 5 minute
drive to a another crag that should be a bit warmer. This approach
is not too bad and the distance to the crag is right in my comfort
zone.<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/approach1.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="500" height="667" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
We decide to tick the entire cliff, and since they are all pretty
easy, we actually have a chance this time.<br>
Here is Will on something....<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/3rd.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="375" height="500" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
And Susan leading something that we thought was something else....
she thought it was a heavy gravity day until we found out she
was on a harder route than planned... this happens out there.
The guidebook is pretty darn sad, and most crag drawings look
like a lump of mashed potatoes with a few lines drawn about the
mound. But I digress....<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/4th.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="413" height="550" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
Here is Will bouldering up to the first clip on something.. Susan
is ready to spot him if a mishap occurs.... Will thinks she will
save him... this theory is still unproven.<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/5th.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="375" height="500" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
Susan just keeps on leading these things while we watch her clip
away and listen to Barstow radio, which is better than you would
think if you are old like us. Nuthin' but classic rock with a
hard edge to it... We decided the rockin' tunes were worth at
least 3 letter grades in pure power and psyche.<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/6th.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="374" height="500" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
Susan on the sharp end again leading the big meanie of the entire
cliff....<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/7th.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="413" height="550" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
She makes us all lead these damn things, so Will goes next.....
I'm giving the usual belay.<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/beerbelay1.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="300" height="400" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
Then will decides to get sketched out since there are basically
ZERO holds up top... and he takes a whistler.... and clangs back
into the underside of the overhang and does some sorta damage
to his patella.... In the trade I think they call it "blunt
force trauma". We quickly get him a beer, as we carry no
first aid kit. Here he is moments before he pitched.<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/ripper.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="375" height="365" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"></center><p></p>

<p></p><center>The only good thing to come out of Wills ripper was
the massive enhancement that my package received from my harness.
It was so grand, that I had Susan snap a pic just in case Ron
Jeremy ever retires.<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/package1.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="200" height="267" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
Ok... the crag is now ticked according to the guidebook... and
it's getting late. But, there are two more routes down at the
scabby end of the cliff that are not in the guide, but for some
reason we must do... Sooze leads them up in about 3 minutes flat.<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/8.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="300" height="400" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
True to New Jack form, I was shot and nearly killed just as we
were coiling the ropes and waxing our draws...<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/dead1.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="371" height="375" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
And then the next day.... Will is still dust. The booze, ice,
and pills we gave him when we got back to Casa del Pescado could
not overcome the patella situation. That did not get me off the
hook though... Sooze made me go into the Monument (that would
be Joshua Tree National Park for you young'uns) to do more routes.<br>
<br>
We pick a nice sunny crag and start ticking them off.... Sooze
gets the 3 star 5.9.<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/peabodys-peril1. | prepend: site.baseurl }}"jpg" alt="" width="444" height="643" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
<br>
She also gets its easier twin right next door, which is basically
the same route but with worse rock. It was sort of an adventure.
Now it is my turn to lead. I get something a fair bit harder,
with no stars, some loose rock, suspect pro, and on Mountain
Project a local guide said something like "sketchy pro,
good luck bro..." in the description. I can hardly wait....<br>
<img src="{{ "/pics/rockshark1.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="450" height="600" border="2" naturalsizeflag="3" align="BOTTOM"><br>
It did not disappoint. I pretty much moan the whole way up and
all the hype was true.... Rock was loose... pro was sorta ok....
seemed harder than the rating.... bad anchor.... rap from a slung
horn.... NBD.<br>
For anyone visiting the area, this thing is a "must do"....
When we got home I went directly to Mountain Project and added
stars to this beauty! I wonder what we will do next week?<br>

Hey Russ, we missed you by a day. Sunday was even better, shorts
and t-shirts. All the sport babes were out in their sports bras
dude. We sent all the routes on a wall too. Funny how that happens
there. None of us acquired a bulge like that though (thank god)
but then none of us took the big whipper either! I think we are
too scared of each other's belaying to risk such an event.</font></i></p>

Nothing but pure fun action with this trio! Only exception to
the fun is Will playing whack-a-mole with his knee.<br>
Thank goodness we had those ESB beers &amp; "the drive"
playing on the car stereo.<br>
Points of interest....<br>
Pictures 1 &amp; 2 are taken with sleep still in our eyes - Predator
Wall- Vertigo 11a &amp; Hero Worship 11b<br>
For the record...those are no warm up but I did feel like I got
a cheap microdermabrasion treatment. The wind was howling!<br>
Pic 3 - White Face which is conveniently located 25 yards from
the loo.<br>
Pic 4 - White Head 5.9<br>
Pic 5 &amp; 6 - Snow White 10d/11a<br>
Pic 7 - White Head 10b<br>
Pic 8 - Stemroids 11a<br>
Pic 9 - Crag beer (Natural Ice)<br>
Pic 10 - Stemroids aka knee knocker<br>
Pic 11 - my man's package, that's right ladies he's all mine!!!<br>
Pic 12 - mystery route<br>
Pic 13 - the man sunnin' himself<br>
Overall, the White Face is a good wall. The rock and routes are
much better than they look when coming out of the potty. Multi-star
on each one, warm &amp; convenient.<br>

Looks like you had fun.<br>
I could have easily passed on the visual of the "package"
shot, however. I am scarred for life after seeing that. It was
just wrong.</font></i></p>

Feel like I went six rounds with a midget in a UFC bout...kneecap
is wrecked. Hope to be back in action by the weekend, although
I'm hobbling around like a drunk geriatric right now, so that
may be wishful thinking.</font></i></p>
