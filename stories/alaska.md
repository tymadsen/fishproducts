<p><i><big>This is an account of an Alaskan trip to the Middle
Triple Area by Kevin Thaw and Calder Stratfield in 1996. They
managed to do two new routes, naming them the Alaskan Rose and
Dreams of Sea, both 5.10+ A4-ish. enjoy!</big></i></p>
<p>Alaska's climbing scene revolves around a small strip of <a href="{{ "/pics/tarmac.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">tarmac</a> in Talkeetna. Denali aspirants and
steep seekers alike share the row of Bush Plane laden hangers.
Talkeetna is a minimal township, geared around adventure tourism
and always with a bush plane in its skies. Most Alaskan endeavors
begin here.</p>
<p>On arrival, our pilot to be J. Hudson stated his name and punctuated
his greeting with a minimal hand gesture all without breaking
stride. Maybe the pseudo-crisis after pseudo--crisis of business
occupied his mind or perhaps he was just a man of few words. My
partner Calder Stratford and I busily readied our equipment, addressing
important last minute details. Our VE-25 needed seamsealing, and
a pretty thorough job, judging from all the tales told about Kichatna
weather. We scrounged around for extra stove fuel, necessary for
fattening our skimpy supply. Several homeward bound adventurers,
thoroughly wind and sun beaten, shared our hanger. Some were jazzed
by success, others tried rationalizing defeat;</p>
<p>Our pilot J flew a couple of parties in to McKinley's base
camp, but still remained negative about our chances of seeing
the Cathedral Spires anytime soon. The Cathedral Spires (often
called Kichatna Spires) are located approximately 70 miles southwest
of McKinley amid the Kichatna Mountains. This precipitous granite
region is famed for fickle weather and broken dreams. Many laughed
at our optimism in expecting prompt travel to the climbs. It never
hurt to hope.</p>
<p>Our tensions eased with the arrival of some familiar faces.
Noel Craine, Strappo, Andy and Steve Quinlan now pulled into the
hanger. Strappo and I are ex-patriot Brits, loving to call ourselves
English but would not want to live there again. Noel Craine, a
braver soul, still resides on the pestered isle, tortured by weather
and government. We caught up on trash talk and gossip as they
prepared for the Great Gorge of the Ruth. If our chosen region
was visible while J flew in this crew, we would get the green
light on our project.</p>
<p>On return from dumping Strappo and crew, he had not viewed
the Spires, but was willing to give it a try. Trying to pack our
sizable racks, portaledges, food and fuel seemed to cause Mr.
Hudson great amusement. Our load amounted to four big haul bags
and four smaller packs. Calder, his father Lynn Stratford and
I crammed everything into the small red bird. Our bush pilot only
allowed 850lbs per aircraft, but was less than scientific about
evaluating this sum. Choosing only to eyeball and guesstimate
the total, bulk seemed more our problem.</p>
<p>As he eased forward on the throttle, we quickly became part
of the Alaskan sky. Once airborne J became very charismatic. He
switched into the mode of an enthused guide pointing out the features
and history of the tundra as it swept beneath, and always joking
on his plane's capabilities.</p>
<p>To the North, panoramas of Denali, Hunter , Foraker unfolded
with many appealing routes and just as many steep snow tracks.
Slowly gaining elevation, J still questioned the westerly skies,
a haze protected the spires from our wanton eyes</p>
<p>The <a href="{{ "/pics/tatina.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Tatina Glacier Valley</a> was our
intended locale. J now careened towards one of its more sizable
alpine hunks, then banked hard upping the G force on his air mobile.
He wore an ear to ear grin, easily conveying his love for this
work. During Alaska's dark months J heads to the Great Southwest,
combing the deserts for lost treasure, artifacts, and trinkets.
He thinks strangely of our adventuring, but has his own at heart.</p>
<p>The Cessna's snow landing skis have been hand pumped into position,
and we began the descent, skids eventually digging into the glacier.
After quickly unloading J departed with a final, "Yeah, we'll
come get you if the weathers good."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 9:30 p.m. daylight does not diminish, in fact the term "daylight"
is not very applicable during northern summer time. Using this
late light we ferried loads up to the Tatina's widest point, avoiding
encampment below one of the many sloughing gullies. "When
does it get dark," Calder asked, "August I think"
was my reply.</p>
<p>Alone without the Internet (no Duke Nukem 3D), climbing or
eating is just about the only way to pass time in this locale.
With camp established, choosing an objective was left until the
following day. There seemed no shortage of scope in this stark
gray/white land.</p>
<p>The Tatina's carved valley reminded me somewhat of Chamonix,
a French alpine town that whittled away at many of my youthful
years. The summits around us share many characteristics with the
Chamonix Aguilles, a ridge line located high above its French
valley. Even our latrine had French ambiance, two foot plates
and a pit.</p>
<p>After a day of snow shoeing and scoping potential lines, both
Calder and I felt a little spoiled by El Cap's right side. After
arriving in the Kichatnas with ideals of finding a northern "Sea
of Dreams", a touch of disappointment crossed us on not finding
a huge continuously overhanging wall. Still, no point in worrying;
there are more than enough steep surfaces to soak up our energy.
We chose a Half Dome size spire for an initial objective, a campside
attraction, and load ferrying ensued. <a href="{{ "/pics/route.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Our
route</a> went up a buttress below a long ridge, the lower section
could be climbed via a long diagonal gash, but instead we opted
for a path through a series of roofs to attain the hanging headwall.
A free pitch cleared us of the glacier and the</p>
<p>Under the main roof's centre and out of rope he plugged in
our second belay. At the belays we drilled single bolts to enable
easy rapping without leaving any precious rack. I</p>
<p>On returning to camp we found Lynn, our site engineer, had
filled his days with construction projects. Walls and ditches
now fortified our humble abode. Everything was set up perfectly.
Lynn was not accompanying us for the whole ride, choosing only
a week of sparse living. He brought much relief to tent life,
and was by far the best card dealer.</p>
<p>We awoke to snow beating upon our nylon canopy. Alarm clocks
were left to sound and be ignored. Finally, exiting the tent a
perfect day greeted all. We decided that tomorrow would be our
day instead. Lounging in sunshine and baking fudge brownies passed
the remainder of a much needed lazy day. The Outback Oven turned
me into a chef, rounding off our day with pizza and scones.</p>
<p>The next day, our summit push day, brought a little more wind
than is usually pleasant. We were set up and ready, procrastination
was far out weighed by motivation. A speedy snowshoe approach
and a quick jumar, aided by our psyche for new summits, deposited
us atop the fixed lines. <a href="{{ "/pics/calderdos.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Calder took
the lead</a> while I engaged in belay aerobics. Shadow boxing
and deep knee bends kept me warm as Calder nailed out our rope
to the next station. Cleaning the pitch also warmed me considerably,
but this new found warmth did not help convince me of the next
pitch's freeable nature. Staying in the aiders for the entire
pitch would be easy, but time consuming. Free climbing shoes were
decided upon. During my next debate of whether or not to tote
along the aiders, Calder interjected that if I take them I will
use them, so true. Into our Atom Smasher they went, along with
the hammer and pins.</p>
<p>About twenty feet out with only a badly tipped Camalot, I would
have happily pounded pins and stood in aiders had I been equipped.
Upwards is all that really counts, so I was forced to continue
laybacking the smooth flare. An unexpected sinker hand jam offered
respite and protection, keeping the pitch from getting too scary
for 5.10+. Normally, this pitch would not be what I would consider
a serious grade, but up here things feel very different. The steep
groove/crack eventually ended on a small ledge. The second half
of this stretched pitch encompassed many loose and exfoliating
flakes. It had my interest.</p>
<p>I ran out of rope with my hands on a small shelf. Only the
cords elasticity allowed me to place a meager seven piece belay
above the shelf. I say meager because no single piece was very
good, but their combination seemed to work out fine. With the
rope fixed I was forced to untie to mount the ledge. A snowflake
drifted by, absorbed by my prior lead I had been oblivious to
the sky. The engulfing clouds had slowly crept from behind our
peak's ridge. We must race for the prized summit. With not enough
rope to fix this high, and no desire to repeat the lower pitches,
we quickly free climbed onwards, forever eyeing the changing clouds.
Trading pitches that successively eased moved us toward the last
lead onto the summit ridge. Its extensive lichen crust guarded
the rock against our touch, making for very interesting climbing.
The summit was finally gained, hollow glory was ours to behold.
As we reveled in achievement the snow began falling in earnest.
We abseiled towards safety and the comforts of our pokey yellow
home. Numerous chilly raps finally had us touching down after
many hours on the go. One down.....? to go.</p>
<p>The next morning brought frenzy, Lynn's bush plane was due
to arrive, and once there, he was not eager to stay. Excitedly,
we packed Lynn into the plane, hoping to hitch a ride over to
Middle Triples East Buttress, but were informed that no landing
was available on that side. Rats! Dejected as we gazed up to the
col, it glowered from its aspect three thousand feet above. Dividing
loads between pack and sled, we bolstered dwindling psyches and
<a href="{{ "/pics/tramped.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">tramped towards our obscured goal</a>.
We were not quite traveling light for a sub 24 hour ascent. The
col was guarded by yawning crevasses and very steep snow. Gravity
favored the sleds weight over our forward motion.</p>
<p>Hours of toil passed, and now with the main approach hazards
gone, we gazed down over the other side of the col. Tell-tale
streaks whisked the sky far to the South thus capping our wasted
effort, along with all motivation spent. A storm was approaching.
Ugh! We turned tail and headed back to our sanctuary. As night
fell (only measured by chronology with no relation to light) the
clouds drew around and engulfed us. Four feet of snow then surrounded
us, filling in for just as</p>
<p>The short approach, brutal enough with many feet of fresh uncompacted
snow, saw our snowshoes punching through deeply. With only a few
days left before a mandatory extraction, a sense of urgency was
decidedly felt. The first clear day allowed us to complete two
semi-dry, and quite run</p>
<p>Our Atom Smasher hung high atop the fixed lines, taunting us
the next morning, at times barely visible through the many swirling
clouds. Bad went to worse with rain being our new torment. Snow
seemed preferable at this point because it took longer to soak
the rock and feed the abundant black lichen. Everything was getting
soaked. Hopefully enough days remained to send this route, even
if it meant climbing in weather the day before our extraction.</p>
<p>One more rainy day thwarted us, dowsing everything including
my free climbing psyche. I contemplated suiting up and aiding,
no matter what the sky's state, but we waited. Our resolve was
rewarded with an offering of the best day I believe the Kichana's
can give. In almost warm sunshine, the fixed lines hung loosely
below. My concern of skating on wet lichen was no longer a problem.
Moving off the belay to a thin and crispy flare had me <a href="{{ "/pics/jamming.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">jamming
and laybacking</a>, wishing for some better pro. While out on
lead I was using a long and thin lost arrow to scrub clean the
various foot holds and thin jams. This was the key.</p>
<p>Our plan was to moan up the right most headwall crack. Instead
the cliff steered me left, towards the prouder of the two fissures,
but I could not ignore this perfect ledge stance. I set the belay.
On this route we added single bolt belays with a nice deep rivet
for back up.</p>
<p>From beneath, this soaring golden headwall appeared to have
a "Harding" type slot. Once upon it, this was hardly
the case. Instead, after a short face traverse, I was confronted
by a shallow <a href="{{ "/pics/bottoming.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">bottoming groove</a>. Initially
easily tamed by hand jams, the groove started tapering and thinning
to a mere shallow trough. The slot was interspersed with some
O.K. pro, yet the rock was always crystalline, its teeth claiming
much skin. Halfway out my next lead, with a string of junk pro
behind me, a similar trough now confronted me.</p>
<p>I could not aid now, not after all this. Besides, this new
trough was minus the thin crack in the back, where pro was possible
before. Placing two marginal pieces at the point of no return,
I hung and swung around searching for options. This new view point
afforded a glimpse of some face holds appearing to the right and
some tenuous traversing to what looked like a flake. Leaving my
high pro, (it is hard to consider your follower in moments like
these) the face traverse did indeed link to an easy lieback. I
ran it out redeeming any previously unvoiced inconsiderations
for Calder, and I knew we were in there.</p>
<p>This flake lead directly to a point above the trough then leftwards
into an easy chimney system. I stepped out of the chimney to place
the next belay so we had a clean shot downward, a forethought
for pulling our rappel ropes on the return portion of this journey.
For the next lead, Calder stepped back into the chimney and later
deemed it "hardly climbing" after cruising an easy boulder
hop pitch. After a final 5.8 offwidth pitch, we stoop atop our
spire. We built a cairn, to mark our passing, then headed back
down the route via rap. Our elongated shadows on the wall stretched
eastward as the sun rode its shallow elliptical path.</p>
<p>We dubbed this route "Alaskan Rose," named after
the abundant, sharp lichen with its appearances akin to the garden
bloom. One thing we learned is that Alaska seems to require a
relaxed approach, at least 50% of our time was spent <a href="{{ "/pics/stormbound.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">stormbound</a>.
Just when the cabin fever began building the weather almost always
broke, but sometimes it was only long enough to step outside.</p>
<p>In twenty-three days of glacial life the only human impact
encountered was the occasional aircraft drifting far overhead.
On exiting our glacial home, I noticed the other valleys looked
to contain some steeper looking walls. Maybe everything can look
as overhanging as desired when viewed from a flat perspective.
Perhaps the grass is always greener, or rather, the crag is always
steeper phenomenon is working on us. Who knows? I may have to
return just to be sure.</p>
<p>Now back in the city, my memories of the stifling storm day
boredom luckily becomes hazy, for it is the brilliant climbing
days that hold all the vivid memories. When in the midst of a
situation it is easy to forget or fully appreciate what a retrospective
experience alpine climbing can be.
