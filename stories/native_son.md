<div class="row">
<p>"Go easy on the jug up here" I yelled. "The
upper rope is pretty much</p>

<p>
<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">

</a>
	chopped".
And this is how we began.</p>

<p>I was hot off an ascent of the MescaDawn Wall on El Cap a few
weeks previous.</p>

<p>A basic 3 night affair that was to be the warm-up for the Native
Son, owing to</p>

<p>the amount of sofa time I had logged, this seemed like a good
idea. It wasn't,</p>

<p>but that's another TR. So on with the current circus...</p>

<p>All was well on the first pitch that starts out of a tree to
some sort of</p>

<p>kookie mantle. Erik led this thing to get us off the ground
without any</p>

<p>embarrassment from me and my free climbing skills. The real
climbing started</p>

<p>under a small 
<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/alumhead.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>roof that was fairly severe</p>

<p><a href="{{ "/pics/alumhead.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">alumi-heads</a> out
a seam that headed</p>

<p>straight left. I was in the thick of the real stuff now, a
trial by</p>

<p>aluminum one might say. This pitch quickly eased to good Friends
and somewhat</p>

<p>wobbly belay in a wide groove. So far so good. Erik led the
next pitch and it seemed</p>

<p>uneventful, but while cleaning it the teeth began to show.
Hooking and some</p>

<p>sporty rivets led up to a spot of free climbing of unknown
difficulty. Man,</p>

<p>was I glad this pitch was Eriks lead.</p>

<p>Erik led onto the big ledge to get our rotation right for the
real leads to</p>

<p>come. This way he would lead the 5.9 blocky pitch to the base
of the "Coral</p>

<p>Sea" and then I would lead the next two pitches to get
us settled in at the</p>

<p>base of the "Wing" roof.</p>

<p>We fixed the first pitches to the big ledge and as ritual dictates,
went for</p>

<p>liquor, food, and more liquor. Over the next day or so we packed
the bags and</p>

<p>humped the loads to the base. Blast off was near, and the weather
was hot and</p>

<p>stable...just perfect for a week of maniacal terror mixed with
bored stiff</p>

<p>lounging.</p>

<p>Jugging up to the top of the fixed lines is where our main
lead line got the</p>

<p>chop. I noticed the fuzz falling down around me after changing
over to the top</p>

<p>cord of our fixed lines. Oopsie. The cord was rubbing in two
places and had</p>

<p>worn through to the core and then some. I exhaled to make myself
lighter and</p>

<p>cautiously jugged by the chops. Then I told Erik. No reaction.
I laced a</p>

<p>Jumar into the system to support the ropes below the chop and
told Erik to come</p>

<p>on up. The chop was pretty bad, but we had some tape which
afforded a fine</p>

<p>fix. Going to get a new rope was not an option, especially
with all the tape</p>

<p>we had.</p>

<p>The huge ledge at the base of the "Coral Sea" is
a good place to bivy. We set</p>

<p>up the portaledges and sorted the gear for the morning. The
matter of the</p>

<p>chopped rope never even came up, but I knew that I was planning
to stay away</p>

<p>from the taped end....at least on the hard leads.</p>

<p>Morning was here and Erik led up the 5.9/4th class to a double
runner belay on</p>

<p>a big block. Here is where the dance begins. I snugged up my
helmet, cranked</p>

<p>up some Nine Inch Nails in the blaster and stated out leapfrogging
some small</p>

<p>hooks, vaguely following a line up and left toward a big block
pasted to the</p>

<p>wall. 
<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/coral.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>
</p>

<p>Welcome to the "<a href="{{ "/pics/coral.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">Coral
Sea</a>". The fall was getting pretty bad, and a clanger</p>

<p>onto the ramp below is certain if you skate. I got to the big
block and</p>

<p>started looking for the first piece of real pro on the pitch.
All junk. The block is big</p>

<p>and loose and is in no mood to hold pins or nuts. Now the fall
is looking really bad. I</p>

<p>eventually get a Fish hook pinned in behind a flake with a
3/4" angle. This is</p>

<p>a pretty good piece and would hold a slice of bread on at least
a 10 footer. I</p>

<p>waffled around the block avoiding the thinnest, most sloping,</p>

<p>take-you-to-see-the-reaper hook move ever invented. Finally,
it was time, and</p>

<p>I got on the shitty hook and using a knee on the block, started
looking for the</p>

<p>next placement. Voila! A half in RURP would do the trick and
allow me to move</p>

<p>left into what I hoped would be a good crack. I slung the loose
block and put</p>

<p>on a panic-arrester sling that would activate at 250 lbs. The
crack that was</p>

<p>to be my savior is junk. Now things are getting seriously bad
as far as</p>

<p>zipping the pitch and hitting the ledge. I started pasting
#1 heads in the</p>

<p>loose crack and whenever possible, doubling them up and equalizing
them. These</p>

<p>heads are so crappy I was using them as a braking device just
in case I pulled</p>

<p>the hooks that were propelling me up the flakes just outside
this rotten seam.</p>

<p>I eventually hooked the entire 100ft or so to the belay, still
placing the #1</p>

<p>heads as I went. Survey says, "death fall".</p>

<p>The next pitch was my lead also, and it is a good one. Not
too hard, takes</p>

<p>all the pro on the rack, and is plenty steep. It is a huge
sideways crack that</p>

<p>leads right to the base of the Wing. Near the start it takes
arrows and maybe</p>

<p>a blade or two, then in 165' goes to 4" and then back
down to #2 Friend size.</p>

<p>Superb rock and location. I tied up the belay and since we
decided to leave</p>

<p>our junk on the big ledge and bivy there, I prepared to rap
back down. This</p>

<p>was a much better plan than cleaning and hauling our circus
up to the top of</p>

<p>todays pitches. Erik rapped down from the start of the sideways
pitch and I</p>

<p>did the big 220ft. full air rap from the base of the Wing.
I got back to the</p>

<p>ledge and discovered that my harness was not tied...at all.
It was being held</p>

<p>on by virtue of the girth hitches from my daisy chains around
the webbing used</p>

<p>to tie the harness together. No knots whatsoever. I showed
Erik and in his</p>

<p>low and slow way said, "that shit ain't cool". I
guess my number wasn't up.</p>

<p>We bivied on the ledge and let our thoughts drift toward tomorrow
and the</p>

<p>Wing.</p>

<p>I jugged up to the high point in the morning while Erik cleaned
the previous</p>

<p>pitch. I started to haul the 200lb bags and as sure as it was
horrendous they got</p>

<p>stuck going across the rubble covered ledge. I set up a 3 to
1 advantage on the</p>

<p>hauling rig and started to really put my back into it. The
main haul line was</p>

<p>a 200ft 11mm static cord, but since the station was about 220
feet above the ledge,</p>

<p>I had to use the 7mm zip line to make up the difference. Well
I guess 7 mils</p>

<p>ain't what they used to be, for during one of my mightier pulls
the</p>

<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/sheath.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>
<p>
sheath opened up for about 6 inches. Sheesh, first day and already two</p>

<p>chopped cords. Omen? Maybe...</p>

<p>The Wing is a steep mother with a good crack to start and then
a bunch</p>

<p>of rivets leading up and right out of sight. It is the sort
of pitch that will</p>

<p>make a belayers neck hurt even if he is laying down...it's
that steep. Some</p>

<p>grim large heads await near the end of the pitch, and placing
them looked very</p>

<p>strenuous.</p>

<p>The next pitch is your basic rivet ladder right off the belay
and then some</p>

<p>fine nailing up towards the "K.B. Traverse" on Iron
Hawk. Some dicey hooking</p>

<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/storm1.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>
<p>awaits above and then the pitch 
ends at a good belay station in a rivet
ladder.</p>

<p>It was here that during the night a pretty good</p>

<p><a href="{{ "/pics/storm1.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">storm</a> rolled in and
kept us pinned down basically all day. Thank God the</p>

<p>Olde English were talls and the blaster batteries were fresh.</p>

<p>Pitch 9 is pretty cool climbing over a few loose and expando
cracks and</p>

<p>flakes. Erik motored this pitch and the highlight was finding
some idiots</p>

<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/stool.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>
<p>
stool pasted oh-so-carefully at mid pitch.</p>

<p>From whence it came, I know not....</p>

<p>The belay on this pitch is funky expando and is notorious for</p>

<p>letting anchors fall out during the night. We knew about it
and</p>

<p>it still happened to us. As I jugged up to the top piece in
the morning to start my lead,</p>

<p>two of the belay pins fell out. Yes, it does wake you up. As
Erik cleaned this station, the</p>

<p>flake had slapped shut on a TCU and squashed it flat. Yes,
flat.</p>

<p>Pitch 10 is not so bad except for the really bad fall you could
take if</p>

<p>things went sour. There is *the* sketchiest circlehead move
I have ever seen</p>

<p>on this lurking on the traverse part of this pitch. After that
you just angle</p>

<p>over on small pendulum off a hook to some #1 heads you hope
will stick. A fall</p>

<p>here would be a melon breaker. I pinned a Fish Hook in again
with a 3/4" angle</p>

<p>and led on up. Another small traverse follows that has a super
technical</p>

<p>"hatchet" stack (ground down RURPs) that was just
hideous to get. The problem</p>

<p>is that you need to lean right at a full extension and try
to make the RURPs</p>

<p>stick long enough for you to land a hammer blow. The pitch
is steep enough</p>

<p>that each hammer blow would make me barndoor away from the
placement. Cripes!</p>

<p>I ended up doing a backstep/flag thingy that would make any
Sportclimber proud</p>

<p>and getting some good licks onto the sad RURPs. Whew! It worked.
Near the</p>

<p>end of the rivet ladder a woeful hole shows up that was a bitch
to get</p>

<p>anything to stick in. I think I used a sawed off 1.5"
angle and had to half</p>

<p>mantle it to reach some hook moves before more rivets came
into play. Pretty</p>

<p>casual rivets and the odd hook from here, and it lands you
at a</p>

<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/bivy.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>
<p>
super
<a href="{{ "/pics/bivy.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">bivy</a> site that is clean
to Valley Floor and has tons of bolts.</p>

<p>Nice! The next morning Erik led out on what is called the "Equator",
an</p>

<p>expando but easy traverse into a reasonable crack that takes
tons of pro. The</p>

<p>belay at the end of this pitch is cool and takes big friends,
all the while you</p>

<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/fingerhat.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>

<p>hope they don't
pry off the the main feature on the route, the</p>

<p><a href="{{ "/pics/fingerhat.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">"Golden Finger
of Fate"</a> . It's big, hollow and who knows what holds</p>

<p>this 200ft thing to the wall.</p>

<p>Pitch 12 was marked wrong on our topo and man it got scary
up top. Basically</p>

<p>I was cruising up this big left facing corner that is A1 or
so, nailing away</p>

<p>with arrows and angles. Then it gets wide. Like real wide.
I shimmied inside</p>

<p>and started to armbar the monster and could see all the way
through to the</p>

<p>other side. At one point I had to abandon my cowboy hat to
get further inside</p>

<p>the maw. After tons of groaning I had to hook the rack onto
the bottom of my</p>

<p>aiders so I could get even further inside the chimney. Finally
I got to where</p>

<p>I could get some wide pro way in the back and tied my aider
on as an extendo</p>

<p>sling. Grunt-a-hoy and A1 my ass. Finally when I thought it
was almost over I</p>

<p>encountered a rotten overlap that was super loose and venting
sand. The belay</p>

<p>was still well above me. I stretched out of the chimney as
far as I could and</p>

<p>started to drive an arrow into the loose crack above this overlap.
Nope. The</p>

<p>crack was expando. I tried to push a Friend into the overlap,
but as I</p>

<p>weighted it the sand poured faster and the overlap just kept
expanding. This</p>

<p>was grim. I went back to the crack method and worked in an
arrow stack that</p>

<p>seemed to be holding. Here comes the big test, as I have to
sorta bomb out of</p>

<p>the chimney and onto the piece. If it blows I am so far outta
there it's sick.</p>

<p>I looked down to confirm that the edge of the dihedral was
extra sharp and cast</p>

<p>off onto the pin. It was holding so I hustled up my aiders
and sunk another</p>

<p>pin that made the one I was on shift. Spookville. Looking down
I noticed that</p>

<p>there were drilled hook holes to get around this chimney and
into the crack</p>

<p>proper, bypassing the grievous offwidth and toil. Obviously
the work of a</p>

<p>balless coward, since these were added after the first ascent.
I clipped the</p>

<p>anchor and set up the belay.</p>

<p>Pitch 13 is a straightforward rivet ladder that is in good
shape. Erik</p>

<p>cracked this off in about 20 minutes all tolled.</p>

<p>Pitch 14 is another rivet ladder with a single hook move out
near the end. I</p>

<p>lead this pitch and I was to lead the next one also, so Erik
could have the</p>

<p>last crux pitch. A great belay is at the end of the pitch and
is where we</p>

<p>would bivy. The weather was starting to look grim so I decided
to go out on</p>

<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/a3heads.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>
<p>lead
and get some of the</p>

<p><a href="{{ "/pics/a3heads.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">A3+ heading</a> done
before the corner started to run with</p>

<p>water, which it would if it rained. The pitch was a bear and
had me struggling</p>

<p>like crazy to get in some of the 15 or so consecutive heads.
It is an</p>

<p>overhanging corner that did its best to push me out and away
from the wall and</p>

<p>over backwards. At the top of the corner was a good rivet which
I lowered back</p>

<p>down to the belay/bivy from. We set up our ledges and as a
precaution put on</p>

<p>the rainflys. Since we were already a day or so late from the
first storm, the</p>

<p>food supply was about nil. I had one small salami and some
hard candies. Erik</p>

<p>had a power bar and maybe a can of tuna. We settled in for
the night and then</p>

<p>it began. First came the wind. Then rain. Then wind and rain.
In the</p>

<p>morning it was still raining and snowing and the wind had picked
up</p>

<p>considerably.</p>

<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/seaguys.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>
<p>Over
on the <a href="{{ "/pics/seaguys.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">Sea of Dreams</a>
a party was yelling for help. We</p>

<p>would look over and could not see the color of their rainflys
for the amount of</p>

<p>water pouring over them. They were in a bad way. For the moment</p>

<p>we were fine. During the storm the wind was blowing so hard
that it would</p>

<p>float my ledge out from the wall, turn it 90 degrees and crash
it back into the wall.</p>

<p>This was starting to get serious. I called down to Erik to
see how he was doing and the</p>

<p>word was not too good. He was getting wet and had a down sleeping
bag. Can</p>

<p>you spell death? His ledge fly was in need of repairs before
he got on the</p>

<p>wall and now it really needed work. I peered out of my ledge
and saw his fly</p>

<p>being blown up over his ledge and him laying in a pool of water.
He had</p>

<p>already toughed out a day of this, and it was time for him
to come up to my</p>

<p>ledge and ride out the night.</p>

<p>Erik jugged up to my ledge and in the process of getting into
my ledge copious</p>

<p>amounts of water soaked all our stuff. I was wearing a polypro
suit and had a</p>

<p>Polarguard sleeping bag. Erik was wearing some wet Gramiccis
and some sort of</p>

<p>jacket. He was desperately cold. I jettisoned his wet sleeping
bag and any</p>

<p>wet clothes he had brought with him, and we both listened to
the wails of</p>

<p>horror from the guys over on the Sea. We both got into my sleeping
bag with</p>

<p>his feet pushed into my armpits to try and warm up his feet.
This was going to</p>

<p>be a long night.</p>

<p>A few hours past and finally it was dark. Getting any real
rest was a hard</p>

<p>trick and Erik was not warming up. We were both crammed into
the ledge and</p>

<p>partially into the lone sleeping bag. Shivers were mandatory
and the wind was</p>

<p>still managing to lift us both and float us around. Suddenly
something started</p>

<p>hammering at the outside of the rainfly...WHAM.....WHAM....WHAM.
It was Eriks</p>

<p>abandoned ledge that broke loose from where it was lashed and
being whipped by</p>

<p>the wind into our fly like a cleaver. If it ripped the fly
I truly believe we</p>

<p>would have been dead within minutes. I clawed one arm out of
the fly and</p>

<p>managed to resecure the escaped ledge to the wall. This was
really starting to</p>

<p>suck. We listened to some tunes to make things kinda like normal.
They</p>

<p>weren't. Erik has now been shivering for hours and his feet
were like two</p>

<p>frozen loaves of bread in my arm pits. We ate all 5" of
the salami and drank</p>

<p>some water. I kept trying to get Erik to drink water to no
avail. He was</p>

<p>urinating a bit too much for the amount of fluids in his system
and I knew</p>

<p>there was trouble. His back has been against the wet rainfly
for hours and was</p>

<p>now getting really sore. He claims that his kidney is bowing
out of his back.</p>

<p>I don't want to see it. He takes a few sips of water and a
bit of Powerbar.</p>

<p>The storm rages on. The guys on the Sea are now either quiet,
dead, or just</p>

<p>unable to be heard over the din of flapping nylon and demons.</p>

<p>Every few minutes I doze off and then wake up. The cycle is
agonizing. Erik</p>

<p>is getting colder still, so we decide to stay awake and make
sure he slips no</p>

<p>further. He is getting confused. I try to straighten him out
by telling him</p>

<p>that if he croaks, I will strip him, use his clothes for my
solo to the summit</p>

<p>and chuck him off from here. He chuckles, thinking I am kidding.
At around 4</p>

<p>am things start looking worse. It seems that some of our gear
was hooked into</p>

<p>the ledge in such a way that when the stuff sacks and ropes
and whatnot filled</p>

<p>with water and froze or whatever, it started to rip the bed
of the portaledge.</p>

<p>Now when we moved, even an inch, the bed would slowly rip along
the outside</p>

<p>edge. I cut loose all the heavy things attached to the ledge
and remained</p>

<p>motionless. If the bed ripped completely, we would be in really
bad shape.</p>

<p>For entertainment I suggested that we take our own</p>

</a>
<p><b>obituary
photos</b> and perhaps leave some last</p>

<p>words on the tape deck. I knew that if we turned into</p>

<p>stiffs, John Dill, the head of Yosemite Search and Rescue</p>

<p>would not only develop our film, but play any tapes in the
blaster.</p>

<p>He is that sort of detective. Erik was even less amused now
than before. We both tried</p>

<p>to stay awake and to think warm thoughts.</p>

<p>Morning is here. Erik is still with us and the wind has died
down. I tell</p>

<p>Erik that the guys on the Sea are probably dead, and this is
the storm that</p>

<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/storm2.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>
<p>gets
them all. Every fall in the Valley, that first big</p>

<p><a href="{{ "/pics/storm2.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">storm </a>decimates all
the parties on El Cap. When I was doing rescues</p>

<p>in the Park, it was a given that we would be waiting at the
Rescue Cache</p>

<p>the minute the clouds rolled in each fall. Much like us, you
start in tank tops and end</p>

<p>in body bags.</p>

<p>Erik was still not amused. Just as I was finishing my ghoulish
tale the guys on the</p>

<p>Sea started yelling again. Unbelievable! They were alive and
calling not only</p>

<p>for a rescue but for us to put on the Guns and Roses again.
Within minutes,</p>

<p><i>Welcome to the Jungle</i> played loud and true across the
wall.</p>

<p>We saw the helicopters arrive in El Cap meadow and start hauling
personnel up</p>

<p>to the top of El Cap. There was now a full on rescue effort
going on for the</p>

<p>guys on the Sea. The weather was clearing and the sun was starting
to break up</p>

<p>the clouds. The guys on the Sea were yelling over to us about
us getting</p>

<p>rescued too. I yelled back that we were Ok and would be climbing
on to the</p>

<p>summit and would see them in the bar later that night.</p>

<p>Erik was still in a bad way and his sportclimber frame was
withered to the</p>

<p>brink. I readied myself for the rest of the pitch and got into
my harness and</p>

<p>Jumars and started to sort the gear. All the ropes were frozen
spaghetti and</p>

<p>the whole belay station looked like it was hit by a Zamboni.
It took a while</p>

<p>to sort the stuff and Erik could not really help. I got him
situated in the</p>

<p>sleeping bag and and set up my belay and attached it to his
8-plate. I jugged</p>

<p>the half-frozen line to the high point looking at the ice filled
corner with</p>

<p>all the frozen heads from the previous day hanging like Otterpops.
At the</p>

<p>rivet I got back out on lead and was like a salmon heading
upstream. I tried</p>

<p>numerous times to place a head in a waterfall. No dice. I eventually
looped</p>

<p>some wireds together on my hammer for extra reach and got a
thin nut in</p>

<p>something under the water. I was soaked. Water went in my jacket
and funneled</p>

<p>out my pant legs. I hooked along a big exfoliation that had
water running in</p>

<p>the top and out the bottom, with the water being about 2"
thick on the wall. I</p>

<p>set up the belay and told Erik to Jumar. This seemed to take
hours. Erik was</p>

<p>moving really slow and was not able to swing the hammer to
clean the heads or</p>

<p>pins. I told him to leave all the pro fixed,and to just clip
past all the gear</p>

<p>and jug up here. I hauled the bags as Erik labored up the line.
I set up the</p>

<p>ledge at the station and when Erik got there I put him in the
sleeping bag. He</p>

<p>was disoriented and dehydrated. The lack of food coupled with
the constant</p>

<p>shivering had taken its toll. I checked his ashen fingers for
capillary</p>

<p>response and they refilled like they were powered by red molasses.
He was</p>

<p>done.</p>

<p>I went out on lead on what is the last pitch of the Native
Son solo. Erik</p>

<p>could no longer belay. I slammed some blades into a traversing
flake and</p>

<p>looked up at the rest of the pitch. Grim. In perfect weather
this pitch is A4</p>

<p>and now the hooking and heading section was running with water.
I could see</p>

<p>fixed heads here and there with just the clip loops sticking
out of the water.</p>

<p>No way this was going today. I nailed back to the station to
talk to Erik and</p>

<p>form a plan. I told him I could drill a hook ladder straight
up the only dry</p>

<p>strip of rock and have him on the summit in about 5 hours.
No good. He said</p>

<p>he didn't have five hours. A further exam of his hands showed
frostbite</p>

<p>setting in. I asked him, "if we could get to the summit,
could you make it</p>

<p>down the East Ledges?" No dice. Well it seemed pretty
cut and dried to me.</p>

<p>We needed to get plucked. Erik refused. He did not want to
get plucked. I</p>

<p>gave him the facts one more time. I asked him which would he
rather have: his</p>

<p>fingers and his life, or the summit and no fingers, and probably
not his life.</p>

<p>He deduced that life and fingers was probably a really good
choice. I agreed.</p>

<p>With the rescue on the Sea of Dreams in full swing it was quite
easy to yell</p>

<p>to the climbers on the rim to come over to us and drop a rope.
As it turned</p>

<p>out it was Dan McDevitt and the late Mugs Stump who were on
the rim above us.</p>

<p>They went to get a spare rope and I sorted the gear and prepared
the station</p>

<p>for a gear retrieval at some later date.</p>

<p>Soon a rope attached to a daypack full of rocks was scraping
down the slab</p>

<p>above us and once secured, I tied myself to Erik and started
to Jumar to the</p>

<p>rim. I was trailing our 200ft haul line so I could get our
gear back easily</p>

<p>some other time. Just about 10 feet from the rim the blasted
haul line came</p>

<p>taught and I had to cut it loose. Bummer! We wobbled onto the
rim and the</p>

<p>rescue guys led us up through the snow to the real summit,
where the helicopter</p>

<p>was waiting. We were both flown down to the Valley floor and
Erik was whisked</p>

<p>away to the hospital. I was given a much needed sandwich and
jumped by the</p>

<a href="#" class="thumbnail col-sm-1 pull-left">
	<img src="{{ "/pics/latimes.gif" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
</a>
<p>press. It seemed the rescue had made</p>

<p> <a href="{{ "/pics/latimes.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">all the papers</a> and
some T.V. news as well. </p>

<p>After escaping the media goons I saw my friend Jo Whitford
in the crowd</p>

<p>with a much relieved look on her face. After all it was she
who said, "you</p>

<p>guys should not go up there", and had such bad vibes about
the whole thing that</p>

<p>she gave me a good luck charm that I had tied to my hammer
the whole way. I</p>

<p>think it helped.</p>

<p>Erik was admitted to the Valley hospital and they loaded him
into a hot room</p>

<p>to heat up all his vital stuff. We went to see him later that
same day and he</p>

<p>was looking pretty good. His fingers were going to be fine,
albeit blistered,</p>

<p>and tender for a long time. With a whole bunch of fluids and
snacks his other</p>

<p>problems would be gone in no time.</p>

<p>After any rescue there is the illustrious debriefing with John
Dill. This is</p>

<p>where he asks the same questions and gets the same answers.
It always follows</p>

<p>the line of "did you have a down sleeping bag?" Then
the idiots say "yes".</p>

<p>Then he asks if you had good storm gear. And the idiots say
"no". Then he</p>

<p>asks you, "without a rescue do you think you would have
died?" and all the</p>

<p>idiots say "yes". Both me and Erik know, because
we were those idiots. Thanks</p>

<p>boys!
