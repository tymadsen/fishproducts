            <b><font size="+1">Anyone who ventures out for more than an afternoon 
              will need some sort of luggage. Our Expedition Duffels are made 
              for the people that want to go just a bit further, and be sure their 
              goods will get there with them. Our Expedition duffels have gone 
              all over the world, to big mountains, to jungles, to the laundry, 
              and returned unscathed.<br>

                </a>BEHEMOTH BAG:
            </strong>
            <br>This monster duffel bag is a skycaps nightmare. The "Behemoth" is 41" long and has 18" diameter end pieces, which yields over 10,000 cubic inches of storage. The body is the same 28oz White Vinyl that we use on our haul bags for unreal longevity. The main carry handles are 2" seatbelt webbing with 1" tubular web padding the carry area. The full length zipper is the legendary #10 YKK, built for rugged use and long life. The full length of the zipper is covered by an 18oz Vinyl Coated Nylon protection strip secured by Velcro along the entire length. Carry handles on each end allow the bag to be carried easily by two people, lashed to the roof of your car, or wiggled into and out of tight spots. For the ultimate he-man trick it can be worn on your back (or other places, see photo) for short periods of time.
            <strong>$129.00 ea. Tan only.</strong>

            </strong>Our "Pro Bag" is one sharp piece of luggage. We have put overkill construction methods into the world of high fashion. The result is a totally bomber duffel bag, suave as can be, that can hold a complete rack, rope, shoes, food, and still have enough room for a $3.00 bottle of "Thunderbird". The main body features heavy weight Ballistic Cloth in either Maroon or Yellow, or for that sanitary look, our bomber White or Tan Vinyl haul bag fabric. The carry handles are made from 2" seatbelt webbing with a 1" tubular sleeve on the carry area. For the fashion kicker, we put eye poppin' fur animal prints on the 12" diameter end pieces. The short hair prints are your choice of Zebra, Dirty Zebra, Mystery Bovine, Baby Giraffe, and Ocelot. Holy cow! You've got to see it to believe it. 12" diameter ends, 21" long. 2300 cu. in.
            <strong>$46.00 ea.
                <br>Available in Maroon or Yellow ballistic cloth for the body fabric. If you want haul bag fabric, we only have Tan right now. Baby Giraffe, Dirty Zebra or either of the brown-ish Bovines goes nice with the Tan.
