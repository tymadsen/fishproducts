            <font size="+1">Chalk Bags:</font>
        </strong>
        <br>We feature two chalk bags that have the wildest patterns in any arena. Think of the craziest Hawaiian shirt ever witnessed, exotic pelts, maybe brash prints --- sometimes even Elvis. Now, what if you had these on your chalk bag? You'd be stoked, right? Well here you go --- The "FIST" model is 7" tall with a 5.5" bottom, and the "PALM" model is 5" tall with a 5" bottom. Both bags feature a "best of both worlds" stay open rim that has non-kinking cable sewn in with numerous rows of stitching. Features a collar closure and our unique pile "ligament" inside the bag, plus there is a toothbrush holder for crag maintenance. An easy way to order is to ask for "wild" or "mild" and then pick a color theme.
