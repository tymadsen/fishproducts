    	We feature two chalk bags that have the wildest patterns in any arena. Think of the craziest Hawaiian shirt ever witnessed, exotic pelts, maybe brash prints --- sometimes even Elvis. Now, what if you had these on your chalk bag? You'd be stoked, right? Well here you go --- The "FIST" model is 7" tall with a 5.5" bottom, and the "PALM" model is 5" tall with a 5" bottom. Both bags feature a "best of both worlds" stay open rim that has non-kinking cable sewn in with numerous rows of stitching. Features a collar closure and our unique pile "ligament" inside the bag, plus there is a toothbrush holder for crag maintenance. An easy way to order is to ask for "wild" or "mild" and then pick a color theme.

			The B-1 is a lightweight shoulder pack designed for carrying your boots, chalk bag, and maybe some water and snacks while bouldering. The pack body is our ONS Mesh, an extremely tough and durable fabric that is light in weight and since it is a mesh, lets your boot stink escape into the atmosphere instantly. A single over the shoulder strap is provided and is lightly padded with ShamPelt fur. The top pocket has an outside zipper so you can get to your tape and tincture before your flapper makes you bleed to death. The bottom is made from 18oz. VCN fabric for long life. Approximate size is 2000 cu.in. with a 12" diameter bottom.
