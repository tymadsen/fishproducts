  A strong and extremely durable haul bag is needed as much as any other single piece of gear when wall climbing. If your haul bag should tear or wear through and spill the much needed contents into space, chances are you'll be in a heap of trouble. Fully understanding the need for an exceptional material that would have unreal abrasion resistance and the requisite strength for the application, we set out to find the ultimate haul bag fabric. The now famous FISH White Vinyl has become the often copied standard for all haul bags, regardless of make. We feature this coated fabric on all of our haul bags, and occasionally have colors other than the standard white or tan.

  BUDGET HAUL BAG:
</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <p>
      A no frills alternative for the wall climber who needs a second bag for those really big walls, or is just a little short on the folding green. We've upped the size a bit to 33" tall, 17" bottom, 7500 cu.in. The padded shoulder straps are 3" wide for comfort, and the Budget sports a fully padded 3" wide waist belt. The shoulder straps and waist belt are easy to remove for hauling. Made from our 28oz Vinyl haul bag fabric for long life and comes with a built in adjustable daisy chain for docking at the anchor. Voila! Wall ready. This is also an excellent "first bag" to get your feet wet with. No need to load up on an expensive haul bag before you find out if wall climbing is your game. Plus, you can use the money you save to see a psychiatrist after you bail off your first El Cap route with your mind on fire.

      Here's the ultimate in overflow and gear management. The Atom Smasher is basically a mini haul bag, featuring the same 28oz Tan Vinyl as our Budget Haul Bag, but is 21" tall and has a 12" bottom. This bag is intended to go up on the zip line when using the 3 man wall climbing system. Use it as the spare rack bag on the monster nailups or as the main bag on one of those 18 hour runs up the Nose on El Cap. The easily removable shoulder straps and waist belt are 3" wide and fully padded. Features a very handy double daisy attachment system on the bottom of the bag for clipping in ropes and loose gear. Inside the bag are <a href="{{ "/pics/asinsides.jpeg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" target="_blank">4 
      sewn in daisy chains</a> for clipping gear that you really don't want to lose. This bag has been a best seller and customer favorite for over 25 YEARS and makes a great crag pack too!

        <strong>HAUL BAG TIPS:</strong>
        Cover all exposed stitching on your haul bag with Plastic-Dip tool handle coating. This stuff is amazing and can add years to the life of your haul bag. If it is really dumping rain on you, your haulbag might fill with water and make hauling impossible. If so, punch a hole in the bottom with a knife or short piton for drainage.

        <strong>HAULING TIPS:</strong>
        Never use a biner as a pulley while hauling unless you are forced into it. Using a high quality pulley will make the hauling much easier. Buy the best one you can afford (Russ Anderson pulleys rate very high). Become familiar with advanced hauling systems and the methods of mechanical advantage before going up on a wall. If you can't move the bag because of injury or fatigue, these methods will make the impossible haul possible. Take a fat guy with you and use him as a counterweight. Be certain he never actually gets out on lead or there might be trouble.

        <strong>BONEHEAD TIPS:</strong>
        Never use the daisy chains on the bottom of the Atom Smasher (or on the bottom of our Haul Bags) as the anchor point for a free-Jumar line. It is fine to haul the ropes up to the station this way, but never let anyone Jumar on this line until it is secured to the anchor directly. When your haulbag gets to the anchor, clip in the attached daisy chain to the anchor, then slowly lower the weight of the bag onto the daisy chain. Now, before you take the hauling system apart, pull out enough slack to tie the haul line directly into the anchor. Once the bag is tied into the system with the main haul line, then take the hauling system apart. This way, if the daisy chain breaks, the bag won't rifle 165' and rip the head clean off your partner at the station below.
