      Before there were ever any big hooks commercially available, these were the standard of the day. In Yosemite Valley there were many of these old "ring angle" pitons up on the cliffs that eventually found a new lease on life as a big aid hook. These old school hooks were crafted into a pleasing shape by putting them in a fire grate in Camp 4 and beating them with a hammer to get the desired shape. They were also famous for opening up at the most inopportune times. Fast forward about 35 years and now we are making these under controlled conditions complete with a heat treating operation for strength. These are hand formed and shaped from brand new ring angle pitons. Own a working piece of history! $25.00 eachare hand formed and shaped from brand new ring angle pitons. Own a working piece of history!
