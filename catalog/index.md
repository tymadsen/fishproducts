  FISH Products has been making the stuff of dreams 
  for over 30 years... yes, that was <em>years</em>. Our early days of 
  selling one of a kind items from the back of a VW van in the Camp 
  4 lot has given way to today's global reach via the internet. Our 
  reputation is based on manufacturing overbuilt, innovative, and functional 
  gear of an exceptional value at a fair price.
</p>

<p class="lead">
  This is how we still do things 
  around here,
  even 30+ years later.
</p>

<p>
  Most of our items are made in a semi-custom 
  fashion. This means if you want an extra pocket in your Haul Bag, 
  or a special color for your Atom Smasher, or some other added touch, 
  we can usually do it. We are proud to make all of our sewn goods here 
  in the U.S.A. We use domestic fabrics over the imported variety whenever 
  we can. We are proud to use American made webbing and order our supplies 
  from domestic sources whenever possible. It does make a difference.
</p>

<p>
  We do not have one of those swanky shopping 
  cart things to land all your impulse buys into. But here is an easy 
  way to keep track of all your purchases... click on the <a href="catalog/orderform.html">Order 
  Form</a> link and an order form will appear in a separate window. 
  Lob your goods into the form and then check out when you are done. 
  Inelegant, yes. Adequate? For sure...
</p>

<p>
  Items in this catalog evolve all the time. The chances are real good 
  that the item you receive will not look exactly like the catalog picture. 
  Many color combinations are done completely at random and features 
  do change frequently, mostly for the better. It is the nature of the 
  beast.

<h3>DISCLAIMER</h3>
<p><small>
Rock Climbing and any variation of this sport is dangerous. Risk cannot 
be eliminated. This catalog is not an instruction manual, nor should 
it take the place of good judgment. The equipment offered in this catalog 
can kill you. It can kill you on your first day out to the crags with 
your squeaky clean boots and rope. It can kill a seasoned "Wall 
Master" with a thousand pitches under his belt. If living under 
the threat of death is less than appealing to you, please find another 
sport. Heads do pop off. Families will lose favorite members. Rescue 
people will be forced to scoop you into vile green vinyl bags. Remember, 
you made the choice to climb. Have the guts to take responsibility for 
what you are doing, be it dying, quasi mutilation, or something as simple 
as just losing your mind. If you intend to weasel out of your obligation 
to be responsible, and see laying blame on us as an alternative to your 
ineptness, please do not buy our gear. Please, close your wallet and 
go away now, before it's too late. Bye. See ya. Hasta la Vista.
