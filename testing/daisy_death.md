<p>Topic Author: Russ Walling
    <br>With the latest daisy scare rearing its ugly head again, I did a couple of tests that you might find interesting. I guess the only real questions I have now are:
    <br>1. Should we even be making daisy chains with just a small loop at the end?
    <br>2. Should we be only making daisy chains that a clove-able end loop?
    <br>3. Should we only make daisy chains with the yet to be named "insert".
    <br>4. Please advise....</p>

      Nice idea on the insert Fish.<br>
      Why can't you just use runner-strength bartacks for every pocket
      on the thing? Cost? Weight? Too stiff? Dumb idea? Please advise.<br>

      Say Russ, I'm not really up to speed on this issue/thang. Why
      is clipping the end loop like the first photo the Bad Business?
      I thought the thing to avoid was accidentally clipping only one
      of the bar tacks between loops, which puts you out of the system
      when it blows. Otherwise with all of the pockets blown you should
      still have one big loop with a six someodd bar tack keeping it
      together.<br>
      Like I said, pardon my ignorance. I always have enjoyed your
      tech weenie stuff. And don't forget those beers I bought you
      years ago on Paypal. Ha! The photo illustrations rock, btw.<br>

      C'mon Fet... don't go all "Chicken Little" on us. Daisy
      chains, when used properly, have tons of uses, including in and
      around the anchor. If you know what they can and can't do, your
      chances of survival are higher, but I hardly see stiffs stacked
      at the base of routes like cord wood from daisy failure. YMMV.<br>

      Nice idea Russ.<br>
      If you take a short piece of webbing, pass it through the last
      loop of a standard daisy and bartack it closed into a loop so
      that it floats free like a link of chain, you've got a full strength
      loop at the end that won't get loaded funny or pop open.<br>
      Makes for an easy way to retrofit existing daisies.<br>

      Don't like they way they handle and tangle. The standard long

      of adjustments that stay open when the daisy is weighted. The

      Seriously.... I'll probably go to a clove hitch in the end, tack
      in the insert, or make one of them directional guys. I'll make

      Aren't we over-reacting just a tad? Yes, the deviously deceptive
      and daring "Daisy Clip-O-Death" could get you an "E-ticket"
      for your last ride (right up there with the "Sliding X of
      Death" and the "American Triangle of Death").
      But, as Russ pointed out,<br>
      "... don't go all "Chicken Little" on us."<br>
      and<br>
      "... I hardly see stiffs stacked at the base of routes like
      cord wood from daisy failure."<br>
      Couldn't we just use two 'biners and call it a day?<br>
      We're discussing a way to prevent improper use of equipment from
      killing us, rather than discussing the proper use of said equipment.
      Unless every manufacturer of daisies changed their design, a
      new "specialized" daisy developed by one manufacturer
      still doesn't stop people from using other daisies incorrectly.
      This doesn't seem the best way to go IMO, especially since the
      solution is so simple.<br>
      The flaw is not in the design, but in the use.<br>

      Thanks for all the work Russ on the daisy chain, BUTT.... I've
      been using the daisy chain gig for over 14 years (I used to do
      alot of climing with a 3 person team and switching ropes, arguing
      over who got the next pitch was easier). But the daisy chain
      is for convenience people, to easily adjust a semi hanging stance
      at belays and feeding T/R's. Why doesn't everybody tie in to
      the anchor point with the rope, remember that colorful thing
      you've been trusting your life with up until the Belay?. Tie
      a Freakin backup knot on your lead line, clip your daisy correctly
      to allow a semi comfortable stance and let Darwin take it's course
      on the rest of the idiot nation that has to be protected from
      themselves.<br>
      Leave the Fish alone to test shoes and perfect the perfect econo
      ledge.<br>

      Mark ya dolt!!! That is just the point. For that split second
      where you are into the anchor with just your daisy, and you get
      light headed and untie from the rope for an unknown reason, then
      you decide to clip the haul line from your ass into the bottom
      of your belay loop along with the daisy chain, and then your
      partner uses his belay knife to free the 400lb haul bag from
      the lower anchor prematurely, and it goes all the way to the
      end of the 600ft static line... THAT IS WHY WE NEED A BOMBER
      DAISY SYSTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>

      Unless you're worried about the whole loop breaking (i.e. the
      full-strength sling bar tacking that makes it one big loop) why
      is a clove hitch any better than jsut using a girth hitch? This
      takes up quite a bit less of the sling...<br>

      A girth hitch would be fine, but,..... if your girth hitch is
      not cinched up real tight it has the potential to walk up the
      biner and then when you load it, it unclips itself. Just did
      it myself as a test.<br>
      addendum: I was goofing around with this some more and if the
      girth is not real tight, you can wiggle the biner around enough
      to get the biner to come out of the hitch and fall to the ground.
      Remote chances at best, but it is repeatable in the lab.<br>

      Russ, if you are still working on this fool-proof daisy for anchoring,
      I'd recommend reading this thread.<br>
      Daisy chain question.<br>
      <a href="http://www.rockclimbing.com/topic/111061" target="_blank">http://www.rockclimbing.com/topic/111061</a><br>
      Here is a quote from Largo, in turn quoted from an earlier RC
      thread:<br>
      Largo wrote: pg 5 of sliding x thread<br>
      Quote:<br>
      "That's why a person should never tie into the anchor with
      a tech cord/web daisy. A daisy made out of anything but nylon
      is a serious liability because it can cause shock loading (as
      seen in the recent Rock and Ice expose). You ALWAYS tie into
      the anchor master point with the climbing rope. NO exceptions."<br>
      Jim at Sterling has been drop testing daisies, etc. Defineatly
      stay away from spectra/dyneema. Here are some select quotes from
      sterlingjim regarding some very high force tests:<br>
      "Spectra daisies or slings should never be your sole connection
      to the anchor and probably should not be your primary. It's not
      the force of your partner falling in any scenario that's the
      problem. The problem is you falling directly on the anchor while
      attached with a very static 'umbilical'. How could this happen
      if you're hanging on the sling? Suppose you step up for some
      reason to adjust something or fiddle stuff around then fall backwards
      and BAM! You may break the sling, you may break your back, you
      may crush your kidneys. A whole bunch of unpleasant things may
      happen. Of course it's entirely dependent on how long the fall
      is but static materials care very little about fall factors they
      only care about force and how quickly it is applied.<br>
      Here is a sample of the tests:<br>
      11/16" nylon, impact force 18.4kN, held<br>
      1" nylon, impact force 21.11kN, held<br>
      1/2" Spectra, impact force, 20.02kN, failed<br>
      5/8" Spectra, impact force, 19.2kN, failed<br>
      10mm Dyneema, impact force, 18.9kN, failed<br>
      The impacts listed were the highest recorded out of five drops
      on each. All nylon slings held. All Spectra and Dyneema slings
      failed. All slings had a minimum rating of 22kN. A fresh sling
      was used for every single drop. It should be noted that even
      the nylon slings recorded very high impacts, high enough to threaten
      the anchor and certainly high enough to cause serious personal
      injury."<br>
      He also tested the Metolious PAS:<br>
      "OK, standard disclaimer: this is a very severe test and
      should not be considered conclusive in any way.<br>
      the results:<br>
      They died quick and painless.<br>
      Sample #1) 21.5 kN at 0.014 sec. broke<br>
      Sample #2) 21.7 kN at 0.018 sec. broke<br>
      FF just under 2, probably about 1.9. Mass 80kg. Drop distance
      48"+/- 2"<br>
      So, it looks like good old nylon slings maybe the best thing
      we currently have to anchor with, if you can't use the rope.
      With a nylon daisy you are looking at possibly ripping out body
      weight pockets and ending up with a compromised sling due to
      all the ripped out bar tacks.<br>

      Personally I like cald's design (above) with reinforcment tucked
      inside the next to last pocket. simple, clean, probably cheap
      to manufacture. Having the extra piece tacked on the end like
      Russ's makes me nervous.<br>
      But I have a feeling that now that this is a public issue and
      the risks are well known any manufacturer who doesn't change
      their design is going to get their butt sued if a dad with 5
      kids blows out of his daisy and decks. Current designs really
      are defective to my mind.<br>
      Of course there is always a work-around, clove hitch or two biners
      but hey, sh#t happens and not everyone reads supertopo. Why do
      we wear seat belts.<br>
      Personally I rarely belay off of only a daisy but I've probably
      done it, and probably shortened up by clipping a pocket. I also
      use daisys for jugging and again shorten up by clipping pocket.
      Glad I never had the opportunity to shock-load the system.<br>

      I vote for no more dasies with small loop ends- you can't hitch
      them and there are many unawares that will only use one biner
      to shorten and not twist the daisy.<br>
      Also, maybe in the tags for purchae there should be instructions
      on the best ways to use and the worst ways to misuse.<br>

      Years ago I tied a simple Overhand knot in the last loop of the
      daisy to prevent the death scenerio, this made the last pocket
      smaller. This was a Spectera Daisy, which has it's own problems,
      and the knot ended up being fairly small but has served me well.<br>
      Any reason why this can't be the solution going forward rather
      than many stitches and bits of webbing?<br>
      First daisy I ever owned was a big ol sling of 1" tubular
      with a heap of overhand (doubled) knots in the sling creating
      pockets. Far from Sexy, but safe just the same.<br>
      Any tests with that config Russ?<br>

      Having dealt with this problem before, I switched to the Mountain
      Tools anchor chains. They're stitched to hold 1100lb in the pockets
      and 4950 end to end. I tested a pocket on one I retired And it
      popped at over 1400lb. . Good enough for me. http://mountaintools.com/cat/mt/web/mt_anchorchain.htm<br>

      Russ, I use M.T.'s because of the stronger pocket strength. Others
      I've used blow @ &gt;250lb, which is barely a bounce test. I
      clip end to end and shorten with a key lock biner as opposed

      Yeah, most of the time, you're never going to be able to replicate
      these falls that tests show break runners. It's highly unlikely
      to take a factor-two fall directly onto a completely static anchor.<br>
      That said, I would prefer a dynamic link between myself and an
      anchor, as my *body* would probably break before the runner did.
      I'm wondering why no one has looked into a kernmantle constructed
      anchor system modeled after rope and dynamic to significantly
      lessen impact forces.<br>
      Probably too expensive to R&amp;D.<br>
      I stick with the contention that your best safety practice is
      not to fall off the rock.<br>

      some time: why all of a sudden do we have this insistence on
      safety and bombproofness in our anchors?<br>
      The Death-Loop scenario has held sway over climbers for decades;
      where did this current trend towards applying logic and reasoning
      to daisy chain construction originate? It's a true buzzkill for
      those of us that like death-clipping our daisy loops.<br>

      Dudes,<br>
      Am I understanding that throwing an overhand in the last loop
      will prevent the magic trick? And although this works we are
      trying to come up with a better solution? This is how I have
      my daisy rigged as it made sense to me, but I had to flip the
      damn thing around because it is a BD and the end loop was too
      small for this. So, the end loop is really the harness end and
      vice versa.<br>
      Also, and yell at me if this has been said, rather than adding
      a loop as the above suggestions stated with dual bar tacks and
      what not; couldn't you just make the last bartack full strength?
      That way you would have one bomb-ass pocket at the end of the
      chain, and if the others blow your still set. Right? I guess
      what I am saying is that I see how the "insert" is
      cool, but if you are going to start making them like that, why
      not just bartack the last tack to the max?<br>

      Clove, not overhand.<br>
      Russ, yeah, make em clove size loop only, it's gotta be the simplest
      way, eh?<br>

      Mack is right, we're overthinking this.<br>
      Several pretty simple solutions (that don't involve buying new
      gear) have been presented:<br>
      An overhand in the last loop<br>
      A clove hitch in the last loop<br>
      Shortening your daisy with a second biner, leaving the anchor
      end biner through only the end loop at all times.<br>
      Shortening your daisy with a spare biner from the harness end,
      like you do with your fifi.<br>
      There's probably a few more, I prefer the fourth option as I
      found the clove hitch to be a pain the the crapper when I wanted
      to flip the biner, hadn't tried the overhand yet, but I don't
      think my loops are big enough. Second biner on the end of the
      line seems like a pain. Also, I have a misty nylon daisy that
      has a pretty small end loop, so when I tried out the clove hitch
      option, I just flipped the whole rig around so the girth-hitch
      loop became the end loop since it was bigger. Still don't like
      the clove option though.<br>
      Of course, none of those are idiotproof like a special for-idiots
      daisy would be...<br>
      Edit: If you did produce a daisy with the extra bar tacking,
      etc, you could call it the FID (For Idiots Daisy), kinda like
      the metolius PAS.<br>

      OK so here is my 2 cents worth. Why do any of those options (other
      than full strength bar tacking all pockets)? I have never liked
      or been comfortable with girth hitching or clove hitching or
      over hand knotting one material to another particularily when
      they are of differing dimensions. IMHO the easiest answer is
      to just attach your daisy to your harness with a locking carabiner.
      No knots no fuss full strength.<br>

      philo.... did you read this stuff? It has nothing to do with
      how you attach it to your harness. It is all about the business
      end, not the harness end.<br>

      Russ, I did read it all and I thought most were in agreement
      that a second biner was the easiest and safest way to adjust
      the business end of the daisy. That still leaves all the long
      term wear and tear of the girth hitched harness endof the daisy.
      That is what I was refering to. Modifications to the biz end
      are all well and good but where is the most likely point of crtical
      failure?<br>

      Most likely is far and away an improper clip in the middle of
      the chain. I've read your posts a few times now and I'm just
      not getting what you are saying. If you watch the BD video, that
      is the scenario we are trying to get around. Your attachment
      point to the harness, be it girth hitching, locking biner or
      8 wraps of duct tape has nothing to do with the failure scenario
      in the BD video.<br>

      The issue is when you double clip two pockets. Lets say you have
      a locking biner attached to the end loop in your daisy and you
      decide you want to be a little closer to the anchor. So you clip
      another loop of the daisy into the locking biner to hoist yourself
      a little closer. If the stiching blows out between the pockets,
      and you havent put a twist in the chain before clipping the second
      loop, youre going for a long ride.<br>
      When Im free climbing, I tie in with the rope. When Im aid climbing
      I tie in with the rope and adjust height with the daisy in the
      dangerous method but I have a backup always.<br>

      Russ I know what you are saying and I agree. I am only saying
      that friction of nylon on nylon is a very real risk probably
      more so than a pocket blowing out from shock loading an improperly
      adjusted daisy. BUT, the constant wear and tear at the cinched
      tie-in is a potential and usually un-noticed failure point. You
      don't lower someone by running the rope only through a piece
      of webbing. That should be obvious. But what probably isn't so
      clear is how much damage occurs little by little to regularly
      loaded girthed or cinched webbing material. My original post
      was just to say that by eliminating that weakness<br>
      you inherently improve the safety of the system. Manufactures
      clearly state that girth hitching or clove hitching webbing redices
      the inherent strength by 50%. Why compromise the system before
      it even gets put to the test? I hope this clarifys my earlier
      (somewhat off topic post).<br>
      For the record I use a daisy as a personal safety teather only
      never for critical uses like anchoring.<br>
      Also for the record your wall gear has always been the greatest!
